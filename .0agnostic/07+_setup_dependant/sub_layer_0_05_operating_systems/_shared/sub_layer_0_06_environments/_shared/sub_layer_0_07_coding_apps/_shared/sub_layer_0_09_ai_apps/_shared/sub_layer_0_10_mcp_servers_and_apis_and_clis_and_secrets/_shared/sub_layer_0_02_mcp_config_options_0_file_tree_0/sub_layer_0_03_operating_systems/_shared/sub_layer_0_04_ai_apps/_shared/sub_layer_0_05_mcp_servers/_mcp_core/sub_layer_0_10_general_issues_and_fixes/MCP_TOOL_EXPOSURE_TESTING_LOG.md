<!-- section_id: "537a4ed5-2fda-4a4c-86f2-6d2b7e883f7a" -->
## Testing Timeline

<!-- section_id: "a7c33b2e-b61a-41b2-8152-c7b046bf7f41" -->
### Initial State (Before Login)
- **Playwright MCP Tools**: ❌ Not available
- **Browser MCP Tools**: ❌ Not available  
- **Cursor Browser Extension Tools**: ❌ Not available
- **Error**: "Tool not found" for all MCP browser tools

<!-- section_id: "117cbee2-e3fe-4b30-aee5-20bb768962ca" -->
### After User Logged In
- **Playwright MCP Tools**: ✅ **NOW AVAILABLE** (`mcp_playwright_*`)
- **Browser MCP Tools**: ✅ **NOW AVAILABLE** (`mcp_browser_*`)
- **Cursor Browser Extension Tools**: ⚠️ Not in available tools list (but may still work)

<!-- section_id: "5ff819c7-397a-4e69-a313-b305dd8e2031" -->
### Current Issue: Browser Detection
- **Problem**: Playwright tools available but still getting "Browser specified in your config is not installed"
- **Status**: Environment variables are configured, but browser detection still failing
- **Next Steps**: May need Cursor restart or additional configuration

<!-- section_id: "416f0608-da2c-4dc9-8d07-ecf9c174aa70" -->
## What We Tried

<!-- section_id: "d292337b-f6fb-4a8a-aa13-c5e56a92fca0" -->
### 1. Environment Variable Configuration ✅
- **Action**: Added `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` and `HOME` to MCP config
- **Files Updated**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`
- **Result**: Configuration updated, but browser detection still failing

<!-- section_id: "710f1f24-f78b-4f2f-9902-41955d85d5af" -->
### 2. Cursor CLI Installation ✅
- **Action**: Installed Cursor CLI via `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash`
- **Version**: 2025.11.25-d5b3271
- **Result**: CLI installed successfully
- **Issue**: CLI requires MCP server approval before use

<!-- section_id: "a3fe95fb-44ae-4042-ab94-1f819eedeff7" -->
### 3. Cursor CLI MCP Testing ⚠️
- **Action**: Attempted to list MCP servers and tools via CLI
- **Commands Tried**:
  - `cursor-agent mcp list` - Failed: Servers not approved
  - `cursor-agent mcp list-tools playwright` - Failed: Server not approved
  - `cursor-agent --approve-mcps -p "test"` - No output (may have worked silently)
- **Result**: CLI needs MCP server approval (separate from IDE approval)

<!-- section_id: "2e29698f-e0ab-4dc2-9df7-9b94032bedd7" -->
### 4. User Login to Cursor IDE ✅
- **Action**: User logged into Cursor IDE
- **Result**: **BREAKTHROUGH** - Playwright MCP tools became available!
- **Finding**: Login/authentication may be required for MCP tool exposure

<!-- section_id: "8ba2d41a-e031-424e-87f5-f9ab17b58f23" -->
### 5. Playwright Tool Testing ⚠️
- **Action**: Attempted to use `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate`
- **Result**: Tool available but browser detection still failing
- **Error**: "Browser specified in your config is not installed"

<!-- section_id: "a54b5f74-4352-4a31-ad32-259a21768c6b" -->
## Key Learnings

<!-- section_id: "74fc2eb7-df98-4a45-8d1d-8456836fde14" -->
### 1. Login/Authentication May Be Required
**Finding**: After user logged into Cursor IDE, Playwright MCP tools became available.

**Implication**: 
- MCP tool exposure may require user authentication
- Tools may not be exposed until user is logged in
- This could explain why tools weren't available initially

**Action**: Document this as a potential requirement for MCP tool exposure.

<!-- section_id: "e0ce8879-6745-408a-81b9-06f310ce9538" -->
### 2. Playwright Tools Use `mcp_playwright_*` Prefix
**Finding**: Playwright MCP tools are available with `mcp_playwright_*` prefix, not `mcp_browser_*`.

**Tool Naming**:
- Playwright MCP: `mcp_playwright_browser_*`
- Browser MCP: `mcp_browser_browser_*`
- Cursor Extension: `mcp_cursor-browser-extension_*` (not currently in available list)

**Implication**: Tool naming follows server name in config, not a generic pattern.

<!-- section_id: "40e25305-58d1-4879-9470-6a79418e179e" -->
### 3. Browser Detection Still Failing Despite Environment Variables
**Finding**: Even with `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` and `HOME` set, browser detection fails.

**Possible Causes**:
- Cursor may need restart to pick up environment variables
- Browser path may need to be explicitly set in Playwright MCP config
- WSL path resolution may be causing issues
- Browser may need to be installed via Playwright MCP's install command

**Next Steps**:
- Try `mcp_playwright_browser_install` tool to install browser
- Restart Cursor to ensure environment variables are loaded
- Check if browser path needs to be explicit in config

<!-- section_id: "2abe4e94-90a4-4ad2-b757-0580b8c8e8a0" -->
### 4. Cursor CLI Has Separate Approval System
**Finding**: CLI requires MCP server approval separate from IDE approval.

**Implication**:
- IDE and CLI have separate approval states
- `--approve-mcps` flag exists but may need to be used differently
- CLI may need servers approved through IDE first, or vice versa

<!-- section_id: "79293766-6c90-4e96-8b89-e959eccb9916" -->
## Current Status

<!-- section_id: "5eee2741-121c-4f1c-8fc6-f5b2aecc4ec4" -->
### ✅ Working
- Playwright MCP tools are **AVAILABLE** (`mcp_playwright_*`)
- Browser MCP tools are **AVAILABLE** (`mcp_browser_*`) - **✅ CONFIRMED WORKING!**
- **Browser navigation successful** - `mcp_browser_browser_navigate` worked!
- Environment variables are configured
- Cursor CLI is installed

<!-- section_id: "9f139e98-fd02-4cb1-951f-c00dbcaa32de" -->
### ⚠️ Issues
- Playwright MCP tools available but browser detection failing ("Browser not installed" error)
- Browser MCP tools work but may need headed mode configuration
- CLI approval system needs investigation

<!-- section_id: "c6f246f2-194a-47ae-b111-75d7649b83cc" -->
### ✅ Success: Browser MCP Tools Working!
**Test Result (2025-12-05)**:
- Tool: `mcp_browser_browser_navigate("https://www.google.com")`
- Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Navigated to Google successfully
- Page loaded with full snapshot available
- Browser is running and accessible

<!-- section_id: "efeedbd2-5bfc-4ebd-af8d-4a970b02b1ee" -->
### ❓ Unknown
- Do we need to use `mcp_playwright_browser_install` first?
- Will Cursor restart fix browser detection?
- Do Cursor browser extension tools still work?

<!-- section_id: "9803d4bc-7f6f-4f57-97b1-f4a42a09a4aa" -->
## Next Steps

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Test Browser MCP Tools
   - `mcp_browser_browser_navigate` works successfully!
   - Browser is running and accessible

2. **Check Headed Mode**:
   - Verify if browser is running in headed (visible) mode
   - May need configuration to ensure browser window is visible

3. **Fix Playwright Browser Detection**:
   - Playwright tools available but browser detection failing
   - May need to use `mcp_playwright_browser_install` tool
   - Or restart Cursor to pick up environment variables

4. **Document Success**:
   - Browser MCP tools are working!
   - Login requirement confirmed
   - Update all documentation with findings

<!-- section_id: "a584a786-0800-40e7-894e-fb729ab528c7" -->
### IDE vs CLI Comparison
**IDE Better For**:
- Interactive coding and navigation
- Inline diffs and editing
- Day-to-day development work
- Rich project context and indexing

**CLI Better For**:
- Automation and CI/CD
- Scripted refactors and batch tasks
- Headless/remote environments
- Working from other editors (Neovim, VS Code, JetBrains)

**Hybrid Approach Recommended**:
- Use IDE for interactive work
- Use CLI for automation and repeatable workflows
- Both share same config (rules, MCP servers)

<!-- section_id: "82d30626-548d-4dda-8258-9f4ab0bc1949" -->
### TUI vs GUI Bug Comparison
**TUI (CLI) Bugs**:
- More frequent UI glitches
- Endless scrolling/resetting issues
- Rendering failures and bugged states
- Prompt editing annoyances
- More visible rough edges

**GUI (IDE) Bugs**:
- Less frequent but broader stability issues
- Freezes and crashes (especially on Windows/WSL)
- High GPU usage
- Responsiveness drops

**Recommendation for WSL**:
- Prioritize GUI for interactive work
- Use CLI for automation/headless tasks
- Expect TUI glitches to compound terminal quirks in WSL
