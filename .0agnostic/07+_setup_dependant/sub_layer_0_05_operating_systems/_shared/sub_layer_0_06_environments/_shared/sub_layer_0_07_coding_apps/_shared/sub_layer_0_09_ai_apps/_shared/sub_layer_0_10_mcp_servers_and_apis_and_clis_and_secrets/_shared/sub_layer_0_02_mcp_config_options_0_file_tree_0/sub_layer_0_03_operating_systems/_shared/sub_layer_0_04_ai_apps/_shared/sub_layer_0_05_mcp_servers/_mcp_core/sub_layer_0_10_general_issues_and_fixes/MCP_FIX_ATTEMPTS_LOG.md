# MCP Tool Exposure Fix Attempts Log

**Date**: 2025-12-05  
**Location**: Universal Layer → MCP Servers and Tools Setup  
**Status**: Active testing of all solutions

<!-- section_id: "cdf9dbe0-79a0-4ce9-a00e-d4600f3a2a98" -->
## Fix Attempts Timeline

<!-- section_id: "f3164e2d-825f-4ea1-9f38-30a5789be457" -->
### Attempt 1: Check for Duplicate Entries ✅
**Solution**: Solution 12 - Check for duplicate MCP server entries  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Checked `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for duplicate server names  
**Result**: ✅ **No duplicates found** - All 7 servers have unique names:
- context7
- chrome-devtools
- playwright
- browser
- web-search
- github-search
- filesystem

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Not the issue

---

<!-- section_id: "cc70efea-efe4-49c0-a876-fa972c89dc9a" -->
### Attempt 2: Reorder MCP Servers ✅
**Solution**: Solution 10 - Move problematic servers to top  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Moved `playwright` and `browser` servers to the top of `mcpServers` object  
**Before**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Awaiting Cursor restart to test

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "9ca93fa4-9b28-47e5-9aa6-3d88a2805bdd" -->
### Attempt 3: Use Full Node.js/npx Paths ✅
**Solution**: Solution 5 - Use full paths instead of `npx` command  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Updated `playwright` and `browser` servers to use full npx path:
- Changed from: `"command": "npx"`
- Changed to: `"command": "/home/dawson/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/npx"`

**Why**: NVM-managed Node.js may not be in PATH when MCP servers start

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Full paths added for playwright and browser servers

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "0e5a9dd6-6cd6-4104-b2f8-4ed771d0c411" -->
### Attempt 4: Create Project-Specific Config ✅
**Solution**: Solution 11 - Use project-specific `.cursor/mcp.json`  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Created `.cursor/mcp.json` in project directory (`/home/dawson/dawson-workspace/code/0_layer_universal/.cursor/mcp.json`)  
**Result**: ✅ **Project-specific config created** - Copied from global config

**Status**: ✅ Completed - CLI may prefer project-specific configs

---

<!-- section_id: "fc664c89-2f28-4642-bf04-23b5e7bd182b" -->
## Next Steps (Require Cursor Restart)

<!-- section_id: "f1732ce3-e2b0-4e34-95bb-24fe432e3b63" -->
### Immediate Testing Needed:
1. **Restart Cursor IDE** - Required to pick up configuration changes
2. **Test Playwright Tools** - Check if `mcp_playwright_*` tools work
3. **Test Browser Tools** - Check if `mcp_browser_*` tools work (already working, verify still works)
4. **Check Tool Exposure** - Verify tools are available in available tools list

<!-- section_id: "0ba5a713-bfcf-4556-acc7-b88bbbc4383b" -->
### Remaining Quick Fixes to Try:
1. **Disable Internal Browser Automation** (Solution 9)
   - Go to Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Browser Automation
   - Disable if possible
   - Prevents interference with MCP browser tools

2. **Delete and Regenerate mcp.json** (Solution 8)
   - Backup current config (already done)
   - Delete `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Let Cursor regenerate it
   - Re-add MCP servers
   - **User-reported success** - Worth trying

<!-- section_id: "d7f2b755-11e8-445e-8309-dc6c0c0f00bd" -->
### Medium Effort Fixes:
1. **Update Cursor** (Solution 2)

### Attempt 5: Test After Restart ❌
**Solution**: Solution 6 - Restart Cursor completely  
**Time**: User restarted Cursor  
**Action**: User restarted Cursor IDE to test configuration changes  
**Result**: ❌ **REGRESSION** - MCP tools no longer available after restart

**Issue Discovered**: 
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` is a **symlink** to `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`
- We edited the symlink target, but Cursor may be reading from a different location
- Need to check actual config file location

**Status**: ⚠️ **Issue Found** - Need to fix config location

---

<!-- section_id: "e572ef9b-2f97-44e8-96e9-3d06cdf17f6b" -->

- Created backup before deletion
- Cursor should regenerate config automatically

**Result**: ✅ **Config files deleted** - Awaiting Cursor to regenerate

**Status**: ✅ Completed - User needs to restart Cursor or let it regenerate

**Note**: This is a user-reported successful solution. After Cursor regenerates, we'll need to re-add MCP servers.

---

<!-- section_id: "889d9593-75f7-40f1-97cc-8c04b915bb14" -->
### Attempt 8: Restore Working Config ✅
**Solution**: Restore config that was working before  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: 
- Cursor didn't auto-regenerate config
- Restored from backup that had working configuration (with environment variables)
- Recreated symlink

**Result**: ✅ **Config restored** - Back to state before our changes
