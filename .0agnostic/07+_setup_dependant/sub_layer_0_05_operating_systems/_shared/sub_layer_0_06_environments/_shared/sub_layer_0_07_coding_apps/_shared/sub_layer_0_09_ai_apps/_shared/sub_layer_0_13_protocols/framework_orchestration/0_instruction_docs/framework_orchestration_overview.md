# Framework Orchestration Overview

<!-- section_id: "2b83f640-cefe-4b28-8457-b1733eff28a2" -->
## Applicability
**When to use:** When integrating multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, MetaGPT) into the AI Manager Hierarchy System.
**Where to use:** L0-L2 managers, supervisors, and complex stage orchestration where framework-based coordination provides value over simple handoff-based coordination.
**Scope:** OS: universal; Tools: universal (applies to any framework that can read/write handoff files and spawn CLI tools).

## Overview

This document provides guidance on integrating multi-agent orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, MetaGPT) with the AI Manager Hierarchy System. It explains when to use framework-based orchestration versus simple handoff-based coordination, and how to maintain compatibility with the hierarchy's handoff protocol.

For detailed integration patterns, examples, and framework-specific guidance, see the normative specification:
- **Normative Spec**: `/home/dawson/dawson-workspace/code/0_layer_universal/0_context/-1_research/-1.01_things_researched/ai_manager_hierarchy_system/things_learned/ideal_ai_manager_hierarchy_system/framework_orchestration.md`

## When to Use Framework Orchestration vs. Simple Handoffs

<!-- section_id: "89bcc7f1-c143-4d08-87be-a474f83e4b89" -->
### Use Simple Handoff-Based Coordination When:
- Work is clearly decomposable into independent tasks
- Manager-worker relationships are straightforward (single manager, multiple workers)
- Sequential stage execution is sufficient
- You want minimal dependencies and maximum simplicity
- L3/L4 component-level work with well-defined boundaries

**Example**: L3 component implementation where a manager decomposes a feature into 5 independent components, spawns Codex workers for each via CLI, waits for completion, and aggregates results.

<!-- section_id: "324e03f6-05a7-4865-b071-f45a8b961dd7" -->
### Use Framework Orchestration When:
- Complex conditional logic or branching workflows (e.g., plan → implement → test → fix loop)
- Need explicit state management and checkpointing
- Dialogue-heavy stages requiring multi-turn agent negotiation
- Want declarative workflow visualization and debugging
- L0-L2 managers requiring sophisticated coordination patterns

**Example**: L1 project manager using LangGraph to orchestrate a plan → design → implement → test → criticize → fix cycle with conditional retry logic and explicit state transitions.

## Framework Roles in the Hierarchy

Frameworks can serve multiple roles:

<!-- section_id: "251ec9d0-54d1-4300-a8cd-5fa596c9c4b8" -->
### 1. Supervisors (L0)
Top-level orchestrators managing the entire workflow across layers.
- **Recommended**: LangGraph (for deterministic control) or custom Python/shell scripts
- **Role**: Watch handoff directories, apply tool policies, spawn layer managers, aggregate results

<!-- section_id: "8877c368-4a84-4ded-ab0f-53ddbf6dbf25" -->
### 2. Layer Managers (L1/L2)
Coordinating work within specific layers.
- **L1 Project Managers**: LangGraph (complex workflows), AutoGen (dialogue-heavy), or MetaGPT (opinionated structure)
- **L2 Feature Managers**: CrewAI (natural team abstraction) or LangGraph (control-heavy)

<!-- section_id: "4eb545d1-d7dd-423e-911d-5d40a3895b9f" -->
### 3. Specialized Workers (L2/L3)
Teams of agents handling complex, multi-step tasks.
- **Recommended**: CrewAI (role-based teams) or AutoGen (exploratory dialogue)
- **Role**: Execute feature-level work that requires specialized agent collaboration

<!-- section_id: "31a0101d-2c73-4af1-ab09-9a84f60a7ef9" -->
### 4. Simple Workers (L3/L4)
Leaf execution via direct CLI calls.
- **Recommended**: Direct CLI invocation (codex, claude-code, gemini)
- **No framework needed**: Handoff in → execute → handoff out

## Framework Summary

<!-- section_id: "5aa09e1c-f043-4184-8ef0-1bb6531fa155" -->
### LangGraph
**Best For**: Deterministic workflows with explicit state control, checkpointing, and complex conditional logic.

**Strengths**:
- Graph-based state machine control
- Excellent auditability and debugging
- Checkpointing and human-in-the-loop support
- Strong tool integration via LangChain ecosystem

**Use Cases**:
- L0-L2 managers requiring explicit control flow
- Workflows with conditional branching and cycles (plan → implement → test → fix)
- Production systems requiring reliability and observability

**Key Pattern**: Define state machine nodes for each stage/operation, edges for transitions, and use checkpointing for resumability.

<!-- section_id: "d6dc78b0-e461-4c99-9e32-9ea4410e563f" -->
### AutoGen
**Best For**: Dialogue-heavy exploration, negotiation, and conversational multi-agent patterns.

**Strengths**:
- Conversational multi-agent interactions
- Easy to prototype agent collaborations
- Built-in code execution and tool use
- Good for exploratory workflows

**Use Cases**:
- L1/L2 request and instructions stages (dialogue-heavy)
- Rapid prototyping of new agent patterns
- Workflows where agents need to negotiate solutions

**Key Pattern**: Define specialized agents (project manager, requirements analyst, etc.) that converse via GroupChat, then extract structured handoffs from conversation.

<!-- section_id: "80dae44b-327a-4888-98b6-09d7b8c4608b" -->
### CrewAI
**Best For**: Role-based team abstractions with clear task delegation patterns.

**Strengths**:
- Natural "team" metaphor (designer, developer, tester)
- Task assignment and dependency management
- Sequential and parallel task execution
- Intuitive for feature-level work

**Use Cases**:
- L2 feature managers with clear role separation
- Workflows mimicking human team structures
- Parallel execution of independent subtasks

**Key Pattern**: Define role-based agents (UI designer, backend developer, QA engineer), assign tasks with dependencies, execute crew in sequential or parallel mode.

<!-- section_id: "68d18b23-a02a-4d7c-8790-b3b64a484149" -->
### MetaGPT
**Best For**: Opinionated "software team in a box" with standardized artifacts (PRDs, design docs, code).

**Strengths**:
- Prescriptive software engineering roles (PM, architect, engineer)
- Structured document outputs
- Comprehensive end-to-end feature development
- Batteries-included approach

**Use Cases**:
- L1/L2 managers for greenfield feature development
- Projects wanting standardized documentation outputs
- Teams preferring opinionated structure over flexibility

**Key Pattern**: Hire pre-defined roles (ProductManager, Architect, Engineer), run project with task description, extract standardized artifacts.

### CrewAI as L2 Feature Manager

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
import json

# Load incoming handoff
with open("layer_2_auth/2.01_manager_handoff_documents/incoming.json") as f:
    handoff = json.load(f)

# Define role-based agents
ui_designer = Agent(
    role="UI/UX Designer",

## Hybrid Patterns

Frameworks can be mixed within the hierarchy:

**Pattern 1: LangGraph Supervisor + CrewAI Features**
- L0: LangGraph supervisor managing overall workflow
- L1: LangGraph project managers
- L2: CrewAI "teams" for each feature
- L3: Direct CLI calls (codex, claude-code) as workers

**Pattern 2: AutoGen Planning + LangGraph Execution**
- Request/Instructions: AutoGen for dialogue
- Planning: AutoGen for collaborative planning
- Implementation onward: LangGraph for deterministic execution

**Pattern 3: Framework-Free Supervisor + Framework Workers**
- Supervisor: Simple Python/shell scripts watching handoffs
- L1/L2 Managers: Framework-based (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- L3/L4 Workers: Direct CLI tools (codex, gemini, claude-code)

---

<!-- section_id: "76145cd2-645f-414b-953c-7dd9712d2290" -->
## When to Skip Frameworks

You may not need a framework at all if:
- Work is straightforward and decomposable
- Simple shell scripts or Python can coordinate CLI calls
- You want minimal dependencies
- Handoff protocol is sufficient for coordination

**Example**: L2 feature manager that:
1. Reads incoming handoff
2. Decomposes into 3 component tasks
3. Spawns 3 Codex workers via `subprocess.run(["codex", ...])`
4. Waits for all to complete
5. Aggregates outgoing handoffs
6. Writes L2 outgoing handoff

No framework needed - just handoffs and CLI calls.

## Migration Path

If starting from scratch or migrating existing workflows:

**Phase 1: Manual CLI Orchestration** (Week 1-2)
- Use shell scripts to chain claude-code, codex, gemini
- Handoffs as simple JSON files
- Manual supervision

**Phase 2: Prototype with AutoGen/CrewAI** (Week 3-4)
- Implement L1/L2 managers with AutoGen or CrewAI
- Keep L3 workers as direct CLI calls
- Test multi-agent patterns

**Phase 3: Formalize with LangGraph** (Week 5-8)
- Convert successful patterns to LangGraph for production
- Add checkpointing, error recovery, monitoring
- Scale to more layers and parallel workers

**Phase 4: Hybrid Optimization** (Ongoing)
- Use frameworks where they excel
- Direct CLI calls for simple workers
- Continuous improvement based on metrics

## Summary

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Frameworks are optional** - The hierarchy works with simple CLI orchestration
2. **Frameworks are composable** - Mix and match based on layer/stage needs
3. **Handoff protocol is king** - Any framework must respect the handoff abstraction
4. **Choose based on complexity** - Simple tasks don't need frameworks; complex workflows benefit from them
5. **Start simple, add complexity** - Begin with CLI orchestration, add frameworks where needed

The handoff protocol ensures you can swap frameworks or remove them entirely without rewriting the system.

## When to Use Framework Orchestration vs. Simple Handoffs

<!-- section_id: "157bdae5-eb38-438e-8d58-b15757275191" -->
### Use Simple Handoff-Based Coordination When:
- Work is clearly decomposable into independent tasks
- Manager-worker relationships are straightforward (single manager, multiple workers)
- Sequential stage execution is sufficient
- You want minimal dependencies and maximum simplicity
- L3/L4 component-level work with well-defined boundaries

**Example**: L3 component implementation where a manager decomposes a feature into 5 independent components, spawns Codex workers for each via CLI, waits for completion, and aggregates results.

### Use Framework Orchestration When:
- Complex conditional logic or branching workflows (e.g., plan → implement → test → fix loop)
- Need explicit state management and checkpointing
- Dialogue-heavy stages requiring multi-turn agent negotiation
- Want declarative workflow visualization and debugging
- L0-L2 managers requiring sophisticated coordination patterns

**Example**: L1 project manager using LangGraph to orchestrate a plan → design → implement → test → criticize → fix cycle with conditional retry logic and explicit state transitions.

- **L1 Project Managers**: LangGraph (complex workflows), AutoGen (dialogue-heavy), or MetaGPT (opinionated structure)
- **L2 Feature Managers**: CrewAI (natural team abstraction) or LangGraph (control-heavy)

<!-- section_id: "edd6661f-d020-484c-ae9a-f21bcffea5d8" -->
### 3. Specialized Workers (L2/L3)
Teams of agents handling complex, multi-step tasks.
- **Recommended**: CrewAI (role-based teams) or AutoGen (exploratory dialogue)
- **Role**: Execute feature-level work that requires specialized agent collaboration

<!-- section_id: "0c67da0d-b8f1-47bc-a6d0-719e89f20992" -->

## Hybrid Patterns

Frameworks can be mixed within the hierarchy:

**Pattern 1: LangGraph Supervisor + CrewAI Features**
- L0: LangGraph supervisor managing overall workflow
- L1: LangGraph project managers
- L2: CrewAI "teams" for each feature
- L3: Direct CLI calls (codex, claude-code) as workers

**Pattern 2: AutoGen Planning + LangGraph Execution**
- Request/Instructions: AutoGen for dialogue
- Planning: AutoGen for collaborative planning
- Implementation onward: LangGraph for deterministic execution

**Pattern 3: Framework-Free Supervisor + Framework Workers**
- Supervisor: Simple Python/shell scripts watching handoffs
- L1/L2 Managers: Framework-based (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
- L3/L4 Workers: Direct CLI tools (codex, gemini, claude-code)

---

<!-- section_id: "ef057e50-0eba-4296-b62a-d86e7ae2e099" -->
## When to Skip Frameworks

You may not need a framework at all if:
- Work is straightforward and decomposable
- Simple shell scripts or Python can coordinate CLI calls
- You want minimal dependencies
- Handoff protocol is sufficient for coordination

**Example**: L2 feature manager that:
1. Reads incoming handoff
2. Decomposes into 3 component tasks
3. Spawns 3 Codex workers via `subprocess.run(["codex", ...])`
4. Waits for all to complete
5. Aggregates outgoing handoffs
6. Writes L2 outgoing handoff

No framework needed - just handoffs and CLI calls.

## Migration Path

If starting from scratch or migrating existing workflows:

**Phase 1: Manual CLI Orchestration** (Week 1-2)
- Use shell scripts to chain claude-code, codex, gemini
- Handoffs as simple JSON files
- Manual supervision

**Phase 2: Prototype with AutoGen/CrewAI** (Week 3-4)
- Implement L1/L2 managers with AutoGen or CrewAI
- Keep L3 workers as direct CLI calls
- Test multi-agent patterns

**Phase 3: Formalize with LangGraph** (Week 5-8)
- Convert successful patterns to LangGraph for production
- Add checkpointing, error recovery, monitoring
- Scale to more layers and parallel workers

**Phase 4: Hybrid Optimization** (Ongoing)
- Use frameworks where they excel
- Direct CLI calls for simple workers
- Continuous improvement based on metrics

## Summary

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Frameworks are optional** - The hierarchy works with simple CLI orchestration
2. **Frameworks are composable** - Mix and match based on layer/stage needs
3. **Handoff protocol is king** - Any framework must respect the handoff abstraction
4. **Choose based on complexity** - Simple tasks don't need frameworks; complex workflows benefit from them
5. **Start simple, add complexity** - Begin with CLI orchestration, add frameworks where needed

The handoff protocol ensures you can swap frameworks or remove them entirely without rewriting the system.

# Framework Orchestration Overview

<!-- section_id: "179b0cbe-0c4d-4515-b44d-a66d53e032f3" -->
## Applicability
**When to use:** When integrating multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, MetaGPT) into the AI Manager Hierarchy System.
**Where to use:** L0-L2 managers, supervisors, and complex stage orchestration where framework-based coordination provides value over simple handoff-based coordination.
**Scope:** OS: universal; Tools: universal (applies to any framework that can read/write handoff files and spawn CLI tools).

<!-- section_id: "04a5313b-e6b7-4a82-ba91-c07b7fd081ec" -->
## Overview

This document provides guidance on integrating multi-agent orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, MetaGPT) with the AI Manager Hierarchy System. It explains when to use framework-based orchestration versus simple handoff-based coordination, and how to maintain compatibility with the hierarchy's handoff protocol.

For detailed integration patterns, examples, and framework-specific guidance, see the normative specification:
- **Normative Spec**: `/home/dawson/code/0_layer_universal/0_context/-1_research/-1.01_things_researched/ai_manager_hierarchy_system/things_learned/ideal_ai_manager_hierarchy_system/framework_orchestration.md`

## When to Use Framework Orchestration vs. Simple Handoffs

<!-- section_id: "7d8558b0-6aa4-4522-9b4a-122b390013bd" -->
### Use Simple Handoff-Based Coordination When:
- Work is clearly decomposable into independent tasks
- Manager-worker relationships are straightforward (single manager, multiple workers)
- Sequential stage execution is sufficient
- You want minimal dependencies and maximum simplicity
- L3/L4 component-level work with well-defined boundaries

**Example**: L3 component implementation where a manager decomposes a feature into 5 independent components, spawns Codex workers for each via CLI, waits for completion, and aggregates results.

<!-- section_id: "0818f452-6359-4bef-9e64-75f39424ce15" -->
### Use Framework Orchestration When:
- Complex conditional logic or branching workflows (e.g., plan → implement → test → fix loop)
- Need explicit state management and checkpointing
- Dialogue-heavy stages requiring multi-turn agent negotiation
- Want declarative workflow visualization and debugging
- L0-L2 managers requiring sophisticated coordination patterns

**Example**: L1 project manager using LangGraph to orchestrate a plan → design → implement → test → criticize → fix cycle with conditional retry logic and explicit state transitions.

## Framework Roles in the Hierarchy

Frameworks can serve multiple roles:

<!-- section_id: "27ef3da4-7c2b-4b9b-9c96-d4c2cf48b41b" -->
### 1. Supervisors (L0)
Top-level orchestrators managing the entire workflow across layers.
- **Recommended**: LangGraph (for deterministic control) or custom Python/shell scripts
- **Role**: Watch handoff directories, apply tool policies, spawn layer managers, aggregate results

<!-- section_id: "d647f904-5b7c-4223-99e3-aa59a76e8592" -->
### 2. Layer Managers (L1/L2)
Coordinating work within specific layers.
- **L1 Project Managers**: LangGraph (complex workflows), AutoGen (dialogue-heavy), or MetaGPT (opinionated structure)
- **L2 Feature Managers**: CrewAI (natural team abstraction) or LangGraph (control-heavy)

<!-- section_id: "d4fdd341-a2b0-4461-a7b0-be5fe8e21dd6" -->
### 3. Specialized Workers (L2/L3)
Teams of agents handling complex, multi-step tasks.
- **Recommended**: CrewAI (role-based teams) or AutoGen (exploratory dialogue)
- **Role**: Execute feature-level work that requires specialized agent collaboration

<!-- section_id: "a55a90b6-6300-4946-ae0a-5323217662a4" -->
### 4. Simple Workers (L3/L4)
Leaf execution via direct CLI calls.
- **Recommended**: Direct CLI invocation (codex, claude-code, gemini)
- **No framework needed**: Handoff in → execute → handoff out

## Framework Summary

<!-- section_id: "aa6aa20f-5785-4d20-a882-296f7f357952" -->
### LangGraph
**Best For**: Deterministic workflows with explicit state control, checkpointing, and complex conditional logic.

**Strengths**:
- Graph-based state machine control
- Excellent auditability and debugging
- Checkpointing and human-in-the-loop support
- Strong tool integration via LangChain ecosystem

**Use Cases**:
- L0-L2 managers requiring explicit control flow
- Workflows with conditional branching and cycles (plan → implement → test → fix)
- Production systems requiring reliability and observability

**Key Pattern**: Define state machine nodes for each stage/operation, edges for transitions, and use checkpointing for resumability.

<!-- section_id: "21fd07de-57d7-4d41-9d0b-6276ff45561a" -->
### AutoGen
**Best For**: Dialogue-heavy exploration, negotiation, and conversational multi-agent patterns.

**Strengths**:
- Conversational multi-agent interactions
- Easy to prototype agent collaborations
- Built-in code execution and tool use
- Good for exploratory workflows

**Use Cases**:
- L1/L2 request and instructions stages (dialogue-heavy)
- Rapid prototyping of new agent patterns
- Workflows where agents need to negotiate solutions

**Key Pattern**: Define specialized agents (project manager, requirements analyst, etc.) that converse via GroupChat, then extract structured handoffs from conversation.

<!-- section_id: "6387b3ed-4db8-4251-8c42-f21b5e50ef5a" -->
### CrewAI
**Best For**: Role-based team abstractions with clear task delegation patterns.

**Strengths**:
- Natural "team" metaphor (designer, developer, tester)
- Task assignment and dependency management
- Sequential and parallel task execution
- Intuitive for feature-level work

**Use Cases**:
- L2 feature managers with clear role separation
- Workflows mimicking human team structures
- Parallel execution of independent subtasks

**Key Pattern**: Define role-based agents (UI designer, backend developer, QA engineer), assign tasks with dependencies, execute crew in sequential or parallel mode.

<!-- section_id: "60d5747b-967a-4fee-936d-735997a31b41" -->
### MetaGPT
**Best For**: Opinionated "software team in a box" with standardized artifacts (PRDs, design docs, code).

**Strengths**:
- Prescriptive software engineering roles (PM, architect, engineer)
- Structured document outputs
- Comprehensive end-to-end feature development
- Batteries-included approach

**Use Cases**:
- L1/L2 managers for greenfield feature development
- Projects wanting standardized documentation outputs
- Teams preferring opinionated structure over flexibility

**Key Pattern**: Hire pre-defined roles (ProductManager, Architect, Engineer), run project with task description, extract standardized artifacts.

## Integration Checklist

When integrating a framework into the hierarchy, ensure:

- [ ] **Handoff Compatibility**: Can it read/write JSON handoffs per the canonical schema?
- [ ] **Context Loading**: Can it load cascading CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md files?
- [ ] **Tool Integration**: Can it call external CLIs (codex, gemini, claude-code)?
- [ ] **State Persistence**: Does it preserve handoff state across runs?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Can it report failures in handoff format?
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Does it support concurrent worker spawning?
- [ ] **Observability**: Can you inspect agent interactions and decisions?
