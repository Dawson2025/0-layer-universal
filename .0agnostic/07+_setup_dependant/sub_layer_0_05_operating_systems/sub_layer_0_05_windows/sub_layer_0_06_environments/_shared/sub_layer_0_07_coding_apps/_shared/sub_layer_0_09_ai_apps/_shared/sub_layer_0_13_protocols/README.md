# Universal Protocols

This sub-layer contains standard operating procedures (SOPs) and protocols that apply across all projects and features, ensuring consistent and high-quality execution of tasks.

It is organized as a **workflow feature**, following the same pattern described in the layer/stage framework:

- `0_instruction_docs/` – protocol definitions and standards (what the protocols are).
- `0.03_workflow_creation/` – manager system + stages for designing/maintaining protocol workflows.
- `0.04_workflows/` – concrete protocol workflows (how the protocols are applied step-by-step).
- `0.05_results/` – aggregated results, metrics, and retrospectives from running those workflows.

## Protocols

<!-- section_id: "2e2776ec-49b9-4b20-800e-36963f2843c6" -->
### 1. Verification
- **Small Batch Protocol**: `small_batch_verification/0_instruction_docs/small_batch_verification_protocol.md` - Guidelines for iterative testing and verification.

<!-- section_id: "2ee1ee7f-d80c-4c70-acbb-5d5b8c020938" -->
### 2. Research File Documentation & Organization
- **File Documentation Protocol**: `file_documentation_and_organization/0_instruction_docs/file_documentation_and_organization_protocol.md` - Steps for turning large raw files (e.g., chat transcripts, research logs) into structured `chat_history`, `things_learned`, and `overview` docs that are easy for agents to use.

<!-- section_id: "7cfd8275-94f8-4c92-9455-3a8b9354161d" -->
### 3. Protocol Writing Standard
- **Protocol Writing Standard**: `protocol_writing_standard/0_instruction_docs/protocol_writing_standard.md` - Standard format and conventions for writing protocol documents, including OS/tool specificity conventions.

<!-- section_id: "ae3872a7-43c5-483b-9a49-774e05a01a16" -->
### 4. Memory Handling
- **Memory Handling Protocol**: `memory_handling/0_instruction_docs/memory_handling_protocol.md` - Guidelines for handling "remember this" requests and long-term memory storage.

<!-- section_id: "1f5c0021-a804-48e4-879a-2aa35baa2af9" -->
### 5. Reordering Operations
- **Reordering Operations Protocol**: `reordering_operations/0_instruction_docs/reordering_operations_protocol.md` - Step-by-step guide for reordering numbered items (sub-layers, stages, etc.) in the context system, including required context loading and registry regeneration steps.

<!-- section_id: "c41f06b5-de1a-4ab8-b79c-2e191ef47eaa" -->
### 6. Framework Orchestration
- **Framework Orchestration Overview**: `framework_orchestration/0_instruction_docs/framework_orchestration_overview.md` - Guidance on integrating multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, MetaGPT) with the AI Manager Hierarchy System. Explains when to use framework-based orchestration vs. simple handoff-based coordination, with minimal integration examples.

<!-- section_id: "c3a525a8-f828-4179-9779-ff0f2bc6cb8f" -->
### 7. CLI Recursion
- **CLI Recursion Syntax**: `cli_recursion/0_instruction_docs/cli_recursion_syntax.md` - Concrete CLI recursion patterns for creating deep agent hierarchies where managers spawn workers via CLI commands. Includes OS-adapted examples for WSL/Ubuntu with Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

<!-- section_id: "9940f787-e6fc-437f-b149-f2a8a619a901" -->
### 8. Observability and Logging
- **Observability Protocol**: `observability/README.md` - Structured logging, monitoring, and observability patterns for the AI Manager Hierarchy System. Defines log levels, structured formats, layer-specific requirements, handoff logging, manager/worker observability, metrics collection, distributed tracing, and audit trail requirements.

Over time, each protocol in `0_instruction_docs/` can be backed by:

- One or more **workflow definitions** in `0.03_workflow_creation/` and `0.04_workflows/`.
- Recorded **results and refinements** in `0.05_results/`.

This lets universal protocols evolve as first-class workflows, not just static documents.
