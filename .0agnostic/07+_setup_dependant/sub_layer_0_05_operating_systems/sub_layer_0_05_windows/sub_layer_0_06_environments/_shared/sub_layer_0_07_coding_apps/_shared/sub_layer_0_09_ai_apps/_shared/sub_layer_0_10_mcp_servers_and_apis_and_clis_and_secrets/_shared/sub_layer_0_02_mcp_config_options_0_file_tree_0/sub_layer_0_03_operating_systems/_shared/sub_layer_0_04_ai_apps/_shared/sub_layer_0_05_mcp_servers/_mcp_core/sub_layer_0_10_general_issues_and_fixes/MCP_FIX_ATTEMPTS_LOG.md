# MCP Tool Exposure Fix Attempts Log

**Date**: 2025-12-05  
**Location**: Universal Layer → MCP Servers and Tools Setup  
**Status**: Active testing of all solutions

<!-- section_id: "3bbe20b6-468c-40c3-b645-16bcda9c5dac" -->
## Fix Attempts Timeline

<!-- section_id: "d30a7863-a241-4fcd-8ed1-d66ab62352b6" -->
### Attempt 1: Check for Duplicate Entries ✅
**Solution**: Solution 12 - Check for duplicate MCP server entries  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Checked `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for duplicate server names  
**Result**: ✅ **No duplicates found** - All 7 servers have unique names:
- context7
- chrome-devtools
- playwright
- browser
- web-search
- github-search
- filesystem

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Not the issue

---

<!-- section_id: "4387a703-52ae-4cc5-9c63-54770b80ea9a" -->
### Attempt 2: Reorder MCP Servers ✅
**Solution**: Solution 10 - Move problematic servers to top  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Moved `playwright` and `browser` servers to the top of `mcpServers` object  
**Before**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Awaiting Cursor restart to test

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "49451157-dad5-430d-8b17-1dcb22b26397" -->
### Attempt 3: Use Full Node.js/npx Paths ✅
**Solution**: Solution 5 - Use full paths instead of `npx` command  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Updated `playwright` and `browser` servers to use full npx path:
- Changed from: `"command": "npx"`
- Changed to: `"command": "/home/dawson/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/npx"`

**Why**: NVM-managed Node.js may not be in PATH when MCP servers start

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Full paths added for playwright and browser servers

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "3787728b-7b7e-4e56-b4e7-0408dee033b0" -->
### Attempt 4: Create Project-Specific Config ✅
**Solution**: Solution 11 - Use project-specific `.cursor/mcp.json`  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Created `.cursor/mcp.json` in project directory (`/home/dawson/dawson-workspace/code/0_layer_universal/.cursor/mcp.json`)  
**Result**: ✅ **Project-specific config created** - Copied from global config

**Status**: ✅ Completed - CLI may prefer project-specific configs

---

<!-- section_id: "4638d83b-6789-4f09-b54c-ce9b0dae4831" -->
## Next Steps (Require Cursor Restart)

<!-- section_id: "e4b149f0-6ae4-4f02-b5c1-dccd1b65fc34" -->
### Immediate Testing Needed:
1. **Restart Cursor IDE** - Required to pick up configuration changes
2. **Test Playwright Tools** - Check if `mcp_playwright_*` tools work
3. **Test Browser Tools** - Check if `mcp_browser_*` tools work (already working, verify still works)
4. **Check Tool Exposure** - Verify tools are available in available tools list

<!-- section_id: "11ddffa1-16e1-48b2-ac7d-c09189b80d4b" -->
### Remaining Quick Fixes to Try:
1. **Disable Internal Browser Automation** (Solution 9)
   - Go to Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Browser Automation
   - Disable if possible
   - Prevents interference with MCP browser tools

2. **Delete and Regenerate mcp.json** (Solution 8)
   - Backup current config (already done)
   - Delete `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Let Cursor regenerate it
   - Re-add MCP servers
   - **User-reported success** - Worth trying

<!-- section_id: "59a69960-89cf-4d09-88ab-6b73ab68d345" -->
### Medium Effort Fixes:

### Attempt 5: Test After Restart ❌
**Solution**: Solution 6 - Restart Cursor completely  
**Time**: User restarted Cursor  
**Action**: User restarted Cursor IDE to test configuration changes  
**Result**: ❌ **REGRESSION** - MCP tools no longer available after restart

**Issue Discovered**: 
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` is a **symlink** to `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`
- We edited the symlink target, but Cursor may be reading from a different location
- Need to check actual config file location

**Status**: ⚠️ **Issue Found** - Need to fix config location

---

<!-- section_id: "05935b40-f14e-4db9-b4cb-bf06a567bbe4" -->
