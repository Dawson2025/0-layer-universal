## FAQ

<!-- section_id: "d7daf6b1-56b0-4061-8139-2a9ea4ee93fe" -->
### Q: Can I access my WSL projects from Windows Claude Code?

**A:** Yes! Windows can access WSL files via:
```
\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\dawson\projects\
```

Performance will be slower than native WSL access, but functional.

<!-- section_id: "74d9c8c5-3836-4e29-b669-b508207b4e8f" -->
### Q: Will both installations share settings?

**A:** No. Each installation has separate:
- Configuration files (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
- MCP server configurations
- Authentication tokens
- Project history

You'll need to configure each separately.

<!-- section_id: "750d5bbc-7f8d-485d-a188-27cb14f755bc" -->
### Q: Can I use the same projects in dual boot?

**A:** Yes, but be careful:

**Option 1:** Shared NTFS partition
```
# Create shared partition accessible from both OSes
# Store projects here
# Both OSes can read/write
```

**Option 2:** ext4 partition with Windows ext4 driver
```
# Keep projects in Ubuntu ext4 partition
# Use ext4 driver in Windows (e.g., WSL2, ext2fsd)
# More complex but better performance
```

**Warning:** Don't access the same Git repo from both OSes simultaneously. Always commit/push from one before switching.

<!-- section_id: "4b904903-3a52-41da-a8f7-2d31ad890dc3" -->
### Q: How much disk space do I need?

| Installation Type | Disk Space Required |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| WSL Only | ~2 GB (Node.js + Claude Code) |
| Windows Only | ~2 GB (Node.js + Claude Code) |
| Dual Installation | ~4 GB (both installations) |
| Native Ubuntu (dual boot) | ~20-50 GB (full OS + tools) |

<!-- section_id: "54987798-c0d1-4720-bf10-fa82f1e5ebda" -->
### Q: Can I switch between installations easily?

**Dual Installation:** Instant switching
```bash
# WSL terminal
claude

# Windows PowerShell
claude --chrome
```

**Dual Boot:** Requires reboot (~30-60 seconds)
```
Reboot → GRUB menu → Select OS → Wait for boot
```
