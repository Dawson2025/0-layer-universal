# MCP Tool Exposure Fix Attempts Log

**Date**: 2025-12-05  
**Location**: Universal Layer → MCP Servers and Tools Setup  
**Status**: Active testing of all solutions

<!-- section_id: "2e91d19d-a755-47e2-b5c1-284ad9abd64a" -->
## Fix Attempts Timeline

<!-- section_id: "d9d6d8cd-f127-487c-8bd8-20cb5f4ed66a" -->
### Attempt 1: Check for Duplicate Entries ✅
**Solution**: Solution 12 - Check for duplicate MCP server entries  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Checked `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for duplicate server names  
**Result**: ✅ **No duplicates found** - All 7 servers have unique names:
- context7
- chrome-devtools
- playwright
- browser
- web-search
- github-search
- filesystem

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Not the issue

---

<!-- section_id: "0da48c6b-1c9d-4bc7-b74f-9039af8e06c5" -->
### Attempt 2: Reorder MCP Servers ✅
**Solution**: Solution 10 - Move problematic servers to top  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Moved `playwright` and `browser` servers to the top of `mcpServers` object  
**Before**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Awaiting Cursor restart to test

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "037cb026-39b9-465f-a6b0-91a4622e2e0a" -->
### Attempt 3: Use Full Node.js/npx Paths ✅
**Solution**: Solution 5 - Use full paths instead of `npx` command  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Updated `playwright` and `browser` servers to use full npx path:
- Changed from: `"command": "npx"`
- Changed to: `"command": "/home/dawson/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/npx"`

**Why**: NVM-managed Node.js may not be in PATH when MCP servers start

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Full paths added for playwright and browser servers

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "518fda20-527b-44a0-8368-835ccb186cfe" -->
### Attempt 4: Create Project-Specific Config ✅
**Solution**: Solution 11 - Use project-specific `.cursor/mcp.json`  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Created `.cursor/mcp.json` in project directory (`/home/dawson/code/0_layer_universal/.cursor/mcp.json`)  
**Result**: ✅ **Project-specific config created** - Copied from global config

**Status**: ✅ Completed - CLI may prefer project-specific configs

## Next Steps (Require Cursor Restart)

<!-- section_id: "6af5cec5-a318-4525-ba67-a63cdb74d7dc" -->
### Immediate Testing Needed:
1. **Restart Cursor IDE** - Required to pick up configuration changes
2. **Test Playwright Tools** - Check if `mcp_playwright_*` tools work
3. **Test Browser Tools** - Check if `mcp_browser_*` tools work (already working, verify still works)
4. **Check Tool Exposure** - Verify tools are available in available tools list

<!-- section_id: "5a15fd4c-ca2f-4624-b266-0eda582c7cc1" -->
### Remaining Quick Fixes to Try:
1. **Disable Internal Browser Automation** (Solution 9)
   - Go to Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Browser Automation
   - Disable if possible
   - Prevents interference with MCP browser tools

2. **Delete and Regenerate mcp.json** (Solution 8)
   - Backup current config (already done)
   - Delete `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Let Cursor regenerate it
   - Re-add MCP servers
   - **User-reported success** - Worth trying

<!-- section_id: "50fe6adf-f3ac-4e4b-98ec-56b949bea51d" -->
### Medium Effort Fixes:
1. **Update Cursor** (Solution 2)
   - Check for updates
   - Update to latest version
   - May have bug fixes

2. **Check Cursor Version** (Solution 21)
   - Verify version compatibility
   - Check release notes for MCP fixes

### Attempt 5: Test After Restart ❌
**Solution**: Solution 6 - Restart Cursor completely  
**Time**: User restarted Cursor  
**Action**: User restarted Cursor IDE to test configuration changes  
**Result**: ❌ **REGRESSION** - MCP tools no longer available after restart

**Issue Discovered**: 
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` is a **symlink** to `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`
- We edited the symlink target, but Cursor may be reading from a different location
- Need to check actual config file location

**Status**: ⚠️ **Issue Found** - Need to fix config location

---

<!-- section_id: "7e9adc65-d0e9-4c46-a1bd-125e5788d2a4" -->
### Attempt 6: Fix Config File Location (In Progress)
**Solution**: Update the actual config file that Cursor reads  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Check `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` (actual config file)  
**Result**: Need to apply same fixes to actual config file

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

---

<!-- section_id: "fda7883f-b58b-49b0-93ce-500752a8ca37" -->
### Attempt 7: Delete and Regenerate mcp.json ✅
**Solution**: Solution 8 - Delete and let Cursor regenerate  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: 
- Deleted `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` (actual config file)
- Deleted `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (symlink)
- Created backup before deletion
- Cursor should regenerate config automatically

**Result**: ✅ **Config files deleted** - Awaiting Cursor to regenerate

**Status**: ✅ Completed - User needs to restart Cursor or let it regenerate

**Note**: This is a user-reported successful solution. After Cursor regenerates, we'll need to re-add MCP servers.

<!-- section_id: "b5902ef4-8eeb-40b7-a25f-d640c1d02664" -->
### Attempt 8: Restore Working Config ✅
**Solution**: Restore config that was working before  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: 
- Cursor didn't auto-regenerate config
- Restored from backup that had working configuration (with environment variables)
- Recreated symlink

**Result**: ✅ **Config restored** - Back to state before our changes

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Ready to test

**Note**: We're back to the configuration that had browser tools working earlier. The issue might be that user needs to be logged in, or we need to try fixes more conservatively.

### Attempt 9: Enable MCP Servers in Cursor Settings UI ✅ **SUCCESS!**
**Solution**: Enable MCP servers via Cursor Settings UI  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: User enabled "playwright" MCP server in Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP  
**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS!** - Playwright MCP tools now working!

**Test Result**:
- Tool: `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate("https://www.google.com")`
- Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Successfully navigated to Google
- Page loaded with full content and snapshot
- **22 tools enabled** for Playwright server

**Key Finding**: 
- **MCP servers must be ENABLED in Cursor Settings UI**, not just configured in mcp.json
- Configuration in mcp.json is not enough - servers need to be toggled ON in the UI
- This is the critical step that was missing!

**Status**: ✅ **BREAKTHROUGH** - Playwright tools working!

### Attempt 10: Test After Second Restart ❌
**Solution**: Test Playwright tools after user restarted Cursor again  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Attempted to use `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate` after restart  
**Result**: ❌ **Tools not available again** - Playwright MCP tools not in available tools list

**Issue**: 
- After restart, Playwright server may have been disabled again
- Tools were working before restart, but not after
- Suggests MCP server enablement may not persist across restarts

**Status**: ⚠️ **Issue Found** - Need to re-enable in UI or investigate persistence

**Next Steps**:
1. Check Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP to see if Playwright is still enabled
2. If disabled, re-enable it
3. Investigate why enablement doesn't persist across restarts
