# Universal Protocols

This sub-layer contains standard operating procedures (SOPs) and protocols that apply across all projects and features, ensuring consistent and high-quality execution of tasks.

It is organized as a **workflow feature**, following the same pattern described in the layer/stage framework:

- `0_instruction_docs/` – protocol definitions and standards (what the protocols are).
- `0.03_workflow_creation/` – manager system + stages for designing/maintaining protocol workflows.
- `0.04_workflows/` – concrete protocol workflows (how the protocols are applied step-by-step).
- `0.05_results/` – aggregated results, metrics, and retrospectives from running those workflows.

## Protocols

<!-- section_id: "3d6e3d33-dc6a-4fd1-a660-2c0eba6ead16" -->
### 1. Verification
- **Small Batch Protocol**: `small_batch_verification/0_instruction_docs/small_batch_verification_protocol.md` - Guidelines for iterative testing and verification.

<!-- section_id: "24d892f6-aa2d-4542-8695-bb8dda685e18" -->
### 2. Research File Documentation & Organization
- **File Documentation Protocol**: `file_documentation_and_organization/0_instruction_docs/file_documentation_and_organization_protocol.md` - Steps for turning large raw files (e.g., chat transcripts, research logs) into structured `chat_history`, `things_learned`, and `overview` docs that are easy for agents to use.

<!-- section_id: "95e6d84a-8a24-4889-b28a-cb7a245e34e5" -->
### 3. Protocol Writing Standard
- **Protocol Writing Standard**: `protocol_writing_standard/0_instruction_docs/protocol_writing_standard.md` - Standard format and conventions for writing protocol documents, including OS/tool specificity conventions.

<!-- section_id: "d12ba309-0385-406e-8994-c925b4b5ec54" -->
### 4. Memory Handling
- **Memory Handling Protocol**: `memory_handling/0_instruction_docs/memory_handling_protocol.md` - Guidelines for handling "remember this" requests and long-term memory storage.

<!-- section_id: "d32eb514-a5b3-4c71-9ad8-bfbbec6f0725" -->
### 5. Reordering Operations
- **Reordering Operations Protocol**: `reordering_operations/0_instruction_docs/reordering_operations_protocol.md` - Step-by-step guide for reordering numbered items (sub-layers, stages, etc.) in the context system, including required context loading and registry regeneration steps.

<!-- section_id: "be5d9472-f1ea-4aa4-9196-b6ef118220fc" -->
### 6. Framework Orchestration
- **Framework Orchestration Overview**: `framework_orchestration/0_instruction_docs/framework_orchestration_overview.md` - Guidance on integrating multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, MetaGPT) with the AI Manager Hierarchy System. Explains when to use framework-based orchestration vs. simple handoff-based coordination, with minimal integration examples.

<!-- section_id: "34fdf5b2-56ca-4358-9be9-f892394b8727" -->
### 7. CLI Recursion
- **CLI Recursion Syntax**: `cli_recursion/0_instruction_docs/cli_recursion_syntax.md` - Concrete CLI recursion patterns for creating deep agent hierarchies where managers spawn workers via CLI commands. Includes OS-adapted examples for WSL/Ubuntu with Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI.

<!-- section_id: "9334d87c-3463-4b93-9716-326cdf8f7182" -->
### 8. Observability and Logging
- **Observability Protocol**: `observability/README.md` - Structured logging, monitoring, and observability patterns for the AI Manager Hierarchy System. Defines log levels, structured formats, layer-specific requirements, handoff logging, manager/worker observability, metrics collection, distributed tracing, and audit trail requirements.

Over time, each protocol in `0_instruction_docs/` can be backed by:

- One or more **workflow definitions** in `0.03_workflow_creation/` and `0.04_workflows/`.
- Recorded **results and refinements** in `0.05_results/`.

This lets universal protocols evolve as first-class workflows, not just static documents.
