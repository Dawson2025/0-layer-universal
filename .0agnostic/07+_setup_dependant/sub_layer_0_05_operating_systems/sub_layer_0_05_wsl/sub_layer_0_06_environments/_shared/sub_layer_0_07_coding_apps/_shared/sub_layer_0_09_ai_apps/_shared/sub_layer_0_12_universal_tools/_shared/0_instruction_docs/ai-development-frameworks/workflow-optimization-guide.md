**Solution**: Make iteration a core part of workflow

<!-- section_id: "d6b878d7-01ca-45a4-9d72-f8d9833a2721" -->
### Over-engineering
**Problem**: Using complex tools for simple tasks
**Solution**: Choose simplest effective tool

<!-- section_id: "8a24a9ba-a33a-4e68-8a95-f3a33a45f216" -->
## Success Metrics

Track these metrics across phases:
