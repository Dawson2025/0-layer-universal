<!-- section_id: "2ae27799-323c-4250-8553-71f77295235e" -->
## Testing Timeline

<!-- section_id: "601ccc87-7433-42c5-b2bb-1821dafaba68" -->
### Initial State (Before Login)
- **Playwright MCP Tools**: ❌ Not available
- **Browser MCP Tools**: ❌ Not available  
- **Cursor Browser Extension Tools**: ❌ Not available
- **Error**: "Tool not found" for all MCP browser tools

<!-- section_id: "6c6e7462-b15a-4ac7-a48f-b0a6fa2f08b0" -->
### After User Logged In
- **Playwright MCP Tools**: ✅ **NOW AVAILABLE** (`mcp_playwright_*`)
- **Browser MCP Tools**: ✅ **NOW AVAILABLE** (`mcp_browser_*`)
- **Cursor Browser Extension Tools**: ⚠️ Not in available tools list (but may still work)

<!-- section_id: "d31cb30e-c5c6-43b0-a72e-5eb60c98fdee" -->
### Current Issue: Browser Detection
- **Problem**: Playwright tools available but still getting "Browser specified in your config is not installed"
- **Status**: Environment variables are configured, but browser detection still failing
- **Next Steps**: May need Cursor restart or additional configuration

<!-- section_id: "90f06dab-ea49-4f62-8688-4f6ee67d9ea5" -->
## What We Tried

<!-- section_id: "248bf4eb-2fa5-4106-b218-d21f5569394d" -->
### 1. Environment Variable Configuration ✅
- **Action**: Added `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` and `HOME` to MCP config
- **Files Updated**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` and `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`
- **Result**: Configuration updated, but browser detection still failing

<!-- section_id: "dc8ca9e6-1ebb-4671-9299-1d92f880c19a" -->
### 2. Cursor CLI Installation ✅
- **Action**: Installed Cursor CLI via `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash`
- **Version**: 2025.11.25-d5b3271
- **Result**: CLI installed successfully
- **Issue**: CLI requires MCP server approval before use

<!-- section_id: "9e1f8e82-cd1e-4ce6-aa95-78f662fd109e" -->
### 3. Cursor CLI MCP Testing ⚠️
- **Action**: Attempted to list MCP servers and tools via CLI
- **Commands Tried**:
  - `cursor-agent mcp list` - Failed: Servers not approved
  - `cursor-agent mcp list-tools playwright` - Failed: Server not approved
  - `cursor-agent --approve-mcps -p "test"` - No output (may have worked silently)
- **Result**: CLI needs MCP server approval (separate from IDE approval)

<!-- section_id: "2848c5ba-aeff-4300-a20e-42604b92aeb4" -->
### 4. User Login to Cursor IDE ✅
- **Action**: User logged into Cursor IDE
- **Result**: **BREAKTHROUGH** - Playwright MCP tools became available!
- **Finding**: Login/authentication may be required for MCP tool exposure

<!-- section_id: "47923b5e-8d43-46a3-943a-1a8c0e6f17cd" -->
### 5. Playwright Tool Testing ⚠️
- **Action**: Attempted to use `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate`
- **Result**: Tool available but browser detection still failing
- **Error**: "Browser specified in your config is not installed"

<!-- section_id: "216ad89d-e3b9-4ebe-b339-7e72781c9a7c" -->
## Key Learnings

<!-- section_id: "8c4b53d7-3ed5-4f93-9a7d-c7350acd9beb" -->
### 1. Login/Authentication May Be Required
**Finding**: After user logged into Cursor IDE, Playwright MCP tools became available.

**Implication**: 
- MCP tool exposure may require user authentication
- Tools may not be exposed until user is logged in
- This could explain why tools weren't available initially

**Action**: Document this as a potential requirement for MCP tool exposure.

<!-- section_id: "26bfb90b-e2d4-4a87-a773-73bbf85e78de" -->
### 2. Playwright Tools Use `mcp_playwright_*` Prefix
**Finding**: Playwright MCP tools are available with `mcp_playwright_*` prefix, not `mcp_browser_*`.

**Tool Naming**:
- Playwright MCP: `mcp_playwright_browser_*`
- Browser MCP: `mcp_browser_browser_*`
- Cursor Extension: `mcp_cursor-browser-extension_*` (not currently in available list)

**Implication**: Tool naming follows server name in config, not a generic pattern.

<!-- section_id: "7aa958d4-032c-40f3-86eb-99a59485793b" -->
### 3. Browser Detection Still Failing Despite Environment Variables
**Finding**: Even with `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` and `HOME` set, browser detection fails.

**Possible Causes**:
- Cursor may need restart to pick up environment variables
- Browser path may need to be explicitly set in Playwright MCP config
- WSL path resolution may be causing issues
- Browser may need to be installed via Playwright MCP's install command

**Next Steps**:
- Try `mcp_playwright_browser_install` tool to install browser
- Restart Cursor to ensure environment variables are loaded
- Check if browser path needs to be explicit in config

<!-- section_id: "e8d4556e-ab39-48c6-8d12-96ec3633455c" -->
### 4. Cursor CLI Has Separate Approval System
**Finding**: CLI requires MCP server approval separate from IDE approval.

**Implication**:
- IDE and CLI have separate approval states
- `--approve-mcps` flag exists but may need to be used differently
- CLI may need servers approved through IDE first, or vice versa

<!-- section_id: "85b1c45c-3768-4754-a190-08fe90161396" -->
## Current Status

<!-- section_id: "d6327388-8f8c-44ac-9c1e-9ec7f3d5c51b" -->
### ✅ Working
- Playwright MCP tools are **AVAILABLE** (`mcp_playwright_*`)
- Browser MCP tools are **AVAILABLE** (`mcp_browser_*`) - **✅ CONFIRMED WORKING!**
- **Browser navigation successful** - `mcp_browser_browser_navigate` worked!
- Environment variables are configured
- Cursor CLI is installed

<!-- section_id: "48481f52-8dbd-4e1b-90ab-5c9161d8a7d7" -->
### ⚠️ Issues
- Playwright MCP tools available but browser detection failing ("Browser not installed" error)
- Browser MCP tools work but may need headed mode configuration
- CLI approval system needs investigation

<!-- section_id: "fa340c25-3a25-44d7-b13e-95840e701837" -->
### ✅ Success: Browser MCP Tools Working!
**Test Result (2025-12-05)**:
- Tool: `mcp_browser_browser_navigate("https://www.google.com")`
- Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Navigated to Google successfully
- Page loaded with full snapshot available
- Browser is running and accessible

<!-- section_id: "53f94125-d607-4df9-9a30-17b697b02d41" -->
### ❓ Unknown
- Do we need to use `mcp_playwright_browser_install` first?
- Will Cursor restart fix browser detection?
- Do Cursor browser extension tools still work?

<!-- section_id: "914f8da6-5454-4120-8be1-1ad63b78e7f8" -->
## Next Steps

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Test Browser MCP Tools
   - `mcp_browser_browser_navigate` works successfully!
   - Browser is running and accessible

2. **Check Headed Mode**:
   - Verify if browser is running in headed (visible) mode
   - May need configuration to ensure browser window is visible

3. **Fix Playwright Browser Detection**:
   - Playwright tools available but browser detection failing
   - May need to use `mcp_playwright_browser_install` tool
   - Or restart Cursor to pick up environment variables

4. **Document Success**:
   - Browser MCP tools are working!
   - Login requirement confirmed
   - Update all documentation with findings

- ✅ **Production-Ready**: Used by developers in real-world scenarios
- ✅ **Security**: Permission system for file operations and shell commands

<!-- section_id: "2351e434-fae6-46ae-bad3-9af6534db86c" -->
### IDE vs CLI Comparison
**IDE Better For**:
- Interactive coding and navigation
- Inline diffs and editing
- Day-to-day development work
- Rich project context and indexing

**CLI Better For**:
- Automation and CI/CD
- Scripted refactors and batch tasks
- Headless/remote environments
- Working from other editors (Neovim, VS Code, JetBrains)

**Hybrid Approach Recommended**:
- Use IDE for interactive work
- Use CLI for automation and repeatable workflows
- Both share same config (rules, MCP servers)

<!-- section_id: "b5ea1276-72ab-4b82-9c05-64620900d677" -->
### TUI vs GUI Bug Comparison
**TUI (CLI) Bugs**:
- More frequent UI glitches
- Endless scrolling/resetting issues
- Rendering failures and bugged states
- Prompt editing annoyances
- More visible rough edges

**GUI (IDE) Bugs**:
- Less frequent but broader stability issues
- Freezes and crashes (especially on Windows/WSL)
- High GPU usage
- Responsiveness drops

**Recommendation for WSL**:
- Prioritize GUI for interactive work
- Use CLI for automation/headless tasks
- Expect TUI glitches to compound terminal quirks in WSL
