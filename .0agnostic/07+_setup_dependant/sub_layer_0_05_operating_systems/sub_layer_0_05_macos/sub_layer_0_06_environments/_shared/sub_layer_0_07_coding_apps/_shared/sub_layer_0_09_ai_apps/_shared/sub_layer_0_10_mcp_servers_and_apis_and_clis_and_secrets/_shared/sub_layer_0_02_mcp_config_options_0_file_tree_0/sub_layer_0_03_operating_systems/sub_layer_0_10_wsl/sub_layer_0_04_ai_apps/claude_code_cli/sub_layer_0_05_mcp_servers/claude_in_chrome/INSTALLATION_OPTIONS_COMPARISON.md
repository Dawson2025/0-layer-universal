## FAQ

<!-- section_id: "9d9ada55-8a40-4a52-8efb-170eab910a83" -->
### Q: Can I access my WSL projects from Windows Claude Code?

**A:** Yes! Windows can access WSL files via:
```
\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\dawson\projects\
```

Performance will be slower than native WSL access, but functional.

<!-- section_id: "f0eb561d-6f93-4268-bd85-9b97d2947276" -->
### Q: Will both installations share settings?

**A:** No. Each installation has separate:
- Configuration files (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
- MCP server configurations
- Authentication tokens
- Project history

You'll need to configure each separately.

<!-- section_id: "914cd922-f93e-4de0-96e2-25f8d76aa25e" -->
### Q: Can I use the same projects in dual boot?

**A:** Yes, but be careful:

**Option 1:** Shared NTFS partition
```
# Create shared partition accessible from both OSes
# Store projects here
# Both OSes can read/write
```

**Option 2:** ext4 partition with Windows ext4 driver
```
# Keep projects in Ubuntu ext4 partition
# Use ext4 driver in Windows (e.g., WSL2, ext2fsd)
# More complex but better performance
```

**Warning:** Don't access the same Git repo from both OSes simultaneously. Always commit/push from one before switching.

<!-- section_id: "b65d843b-881f-488a-bc24-d605d89cfcbe" -->
### Q: How much disk space do I need?

| Installation Type | Disk Space Required |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| WSL Only | ~2 GB (Node.js + Claude Code) |
| Windows Only | ~2 GB (Node.js + Claude Code) |
| Dual Installation | ~4 GB (both installations) |
| Native Ubuntu (dual boot) | ~20-50 GB (full OS + tools) |

<!-- section_id: "c84245bc-36bf-4583-b888-a4c1ee58da58" -->
### Q: Can I switch between installations easily?

**Dual Installation:** Instant switching
```bash
# WSL terminal
claude

# Windows PowerShell
claude --chrome
```

**Dual Boot:** Requires reboot (~30-60 seconds)
```
Reboot → GRUB menu → Select OS → Wait for boot
```
