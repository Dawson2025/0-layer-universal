**Date**: 2025-12-05  
**Location**: Universal Layer → MCP Servers and Tools Setup  
**Status**: Active testing of all solutions

<!-- section_id: "a8b716c0-61b7-4618-8990-b476be4066a6" -->
## Fix Attempts Timeline

<!-- section_id: "df55efcb-d0af-4d79-9e6b-29ba312754db" -->
### Attempt 1: Check for Duplicate Entries ✅
**Solution**: Solution 12 - Check for duplicate MCP server entries  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Checked `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for duplicate server names  
**Result**: ✅ **No duplicates found** - All 7 servers have unique names:
- context7
- chrome-devtools
- playwright
- browser
- web-search
- github-search
- filesystem

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Not the issue

---

<!-- section_id: "d664153d-c36e-4e1d-ba72-a6d240226f14" -->
### Attempt 2: Reorder MCP Servers ✅
**Solution**: Solution 10 - Move problematic servers to top  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Moved `playwright` and `browser` servers to the top of `mcpServers` object  
**Before**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {...},
    "browser": {...},
    "context7": {...},
    "chrome-devtools": {...},
    ...
  }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Awaiting Cursor restart to test

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "d336ad12-350a-46a8-84d6-7345234ce651" -->
### Attempt 3: Use Full Node.js/npx Paths ✅
**Solution**: Solution 5 - Use full paths instead of `npx` command  
**Time**: < 2 minutes  
**Action**: Updated `playwright` and `browser` servers to use full npx path:
- Changed from: `"command": "npx"`
- Changed to: `"command": "/home/dawson/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/npx"`

**Why**: NVM-managed Node.js may not be in PATH when MCP servers start

**Result**: ✅ **Configuration updated** - Full paths added for playwright and browser servers

**Status**: ✅ Completed - Needs testing after restart

---

<!-- section_id: "b47afd36-343b-4197-8a44-17a04a17861b" -->
### Attempt 4: Create Project-Specific Config ✅
**Solution**: Solution 11 - Use project-specific `.cursor/mcp.json`  
**Time**: < 1 minute  
**Action**: Created `.cursor/mcp.json` in project directory (`/home/dawson/dawson-workspace/code/0_layer_universal/.cursor/mcp.json`)  
**Result**: ✅ **Project-specific config created** - Copied from global config

**Status**: ✅ Completed - CLI may prefer project-specific configs

---

<!-- section_id: "c0876d3d-b70f-4a06-aa58-80a2a0e926aa" -->
## Next Steps (Require Cursor Restart)

<!-- section_id: "1781d0c8-4947-4681-8bb5-352f397beec8" -->
### Immediate Testing Needed:
1. **Restart Cursor IDE** - Required to pick up configuration changes
2. **Test Playwright Tools** - Check if `mcp_playwright_*` tools work
3. **Test Browser Tools** - Check if `mcp_browser_*` tools work (already working, verify still works)
4. **Check Tool Exposure** - Verify tools are available in available tools list

<!-- section_id: "d5937397-e71e-490e-a794-28a70358f940" -->
### Remaining Quick Fixes to Try:
1. **Disable Internal Browser Automation** (Solution 9)
   - Go to Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Browser Automation
   - Disable if possible
   - Prevents interference with MCP browser tools

2. **Delete and Regenerate mcp.json** (Solution 8)
   - Backup current config (already done)
   - Delete `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Let Cursor regenerate it
   - Re-add MCP servers
   - **User-reported success** - Worth trying

<!-- section_id: "cb0f949d-c1e9-4945-b4be-5aec67cea681" -->
### Medium Effort Fixes:
1. **Update Cursor** (Solution 2)

**Solution**: Solution 6 - Restart Cursor completely  
**Time**: User restarted Cursor  
**Action**: User restarted Cursor IDE to test configuration changes  
**Result**: ❌ **REGRESSION** - MCP tools no longer available after restart

**Issue Discovered**: 
- `~/.cursor/mcp.json` is a **symlink** to `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`
- We edited the symlink target, but Cursor may be reading from a different location
- Need to check actual config file location

**Status**: ⚠️ **Issue Found** - Need to fix config location

---

<!-- section_id: "1b4c917b-03dc-4a71-982a-b6783c1bc08e" -->
