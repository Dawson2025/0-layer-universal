# Playwright MCP Working Solution

**Date**: 2025-12-05  
**Location**: Universal Layer → MCP Servers and Tools Setup  
**Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING**

<!-- section_id: "96079cc4-e1c7-47e2-9a76-3bcd511a90e4" -->
## Problem

Playwright MCP tools were configured in `mcp.json` but not available to AI agents. Tools showed as "22 tools enabled" in Cursor Settings but were not accessible.

<!-- section_id: "4d6e8ae2-3a41-47ae-b7fb-4b48e025cb02" -->
## Root Cause

**MCP servers must be enabled in Cursor Settings UI**, not just configured in `mcp.json`. Configuration in the JSON file is not sufficient - servers must be toggled ON in the Cursor IDE Settings interface.

<!-- section_id: "94602303-fa4d-4065-b825-fb136581823e" -->
## Solution Steps

<!-- section_id: "772f2359-652e-4c30-9806-396794161852" -->
### Step 1: Configure MCP Server in mcp.json ✅

**File**: `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json` (or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` if symlinked)

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "/home/dawson/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--browser",
        "chromium"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH": "/home/dawson/.cache/ms-playwright",
        "HOME": "/home/dawson"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Configuration Elements**:
1. **Full npx path**: Use full path to npx (especially important with NVM)
   - Example: `/home/dawson/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/npx`
   - Prevents PATH issues when MCP servers start
2. **Environment variables**: Set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` and `HOME`
   - `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`: Points to browser installation directory
   - `HOME`: Ensures proper home directory resolution
3. **Browser specification**: `--browser chromium` flag

<!-- section_id: "37fd802d-d715-4bfa-8239-f48609150c52" -->
### Step 2: Disable Unused MCP Servers (If Needed) ⚠️ **May Be Required**

**If Cursor warns about too many MCP servers/tools:**

**Action**:
1. Go to **Cursor Settings** → **Tools & MCP**
2. Review all installed MCP servers
3. **Disable servers you're not actively using** (toggle OFF)
4. This may free up capacity for needed tools

**Why This Matters**:
- Cursor may have limits on active MCP servers/tools
- Too many enabled servers may prevent new tools from being exposed
- Disabling unused servers may resolve tool availability issues

<!-- section_id: "588bd339-55f7-4491-b19c-3c9a432d96a6" -->
### Step 3: Enable MCP Server in Cursor Settings UI ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**This is the step that was missing!**

**Action**:
1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Go to **Cursor Settings** → **Tools & MCP**
3. Find "playwright" in the "Installed MCP Servers" list
4. **Toggle the switch ON** (should turn green)
5. Wait for status to show "22 tools enabled"

**Why This Matters**:
- Configuration in `mcp.json` is not enough
- Servers can be configured but disabled by default
- UI toggle is the final step to expose tools to AI agents
- Tools will not be available until server is enabled in UI

<!-- section_id: "385b8ca8-b2ee-4c97-9bd1-7fadb1bd5102" -->
### Step 4: Verify Tools Are Available ✅

**Test**:
- Tool: `mcp_playwright_browser_navigate("https://www.aleks.com")`
- Result: ✅ **SUCCESS** - Successfully navigated to page
- Status: 22 Playwright tools available and working

<!-- section_id: "228e6208-59a4-45d8-8f8a-089389e2b62c" -->
## Complete Working Configuration

<!-- section_id: "c29ba2f2-32b8-462d-bbaa-5e0ef42d5b1c" -->
### mcp.json Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "/home/dawson/.nvm/versions/node/v22.20.0/bin/npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@playwright/mcp@latest",
        "--browser",
        "chromium"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH": "/home/dawson/.cache/ms-playwright",
        "HOME": "/home/dawson"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- section_id: "be67e164-e048-4a0c-8c8d-89e80de976d7" -->
### Cursor Settings UI
- **Location**: Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Installed MCP Servers
- **Status**: Playwright server toggle must be **ON** (green)
- **Expected**: "22 tools enabled" status

<!-- section_id: "c357c40c-8aab-41e2-82e9-3ce60b8a73ed" -->
## What We Tried (That Didn't Work Alone)

1. ✅ Configured in mcp.json - Required but not sufficient
2. ✅ Added environment variables - Required but not sufficient
3. ✅ Used full npx paths - Helpful but not sufficient
4. ✅ Reordered servers - Didn't help
5. ✅ Checked for duplicates - None found
6. ✅ Created project-specific config - Didn't help
7. ✅ Disabled unused MCP servers - **May have helped** (freed up capacity)
8. ❌ **Missing**: Enable in Cursor Settings UI - **This was the critical step!**

<!-- section_id: "0a695ef5-2feb-44b7-87b5-37d2f7a315e5" -->
## Complete Solution (All Steps)

**To get Playwright MCP tools working, you need:**

1. ✅ **Configure in mcp.json** - Full paths, environment variables
2. ✅ **Disable unused MCP servers** - Free up capacity (if Cursor warns about limits)
3. ✅ **Enable Playwright server in Cursor Settings UI** - **CRITICAL**
4. ✅ **Verify tools are available** - Test navigation

**All steps may be necessary for success.**

## Key Learnings

<!-- section_id: "8da9c57c-b21d-4687-b425-067935ee0875" -->
### Critical Discovery #1: UI Enablement Required
**MCP servers must be enabled in Cursor Settings UI**, not just configured in mcp.json.

<!-- section_id: "38a38ccd-beca-4995-b46b-f10812de926c" -->
### Critical Discovery #2: MCP Server/Tool Limits ✅ **RESEARCHED & CONFIRMED**

**Cursor has a hard limit of 40 tools total across all enabled MCP servers.**

**Research Findings (2025-12-05)**:
- **Hard Limit**: 40 tools total (confirmed by multiple sources)
- **Warning Threshold**: 40 tools triggers performance warning
- **Actual Hard Cap**: May be 80 tools, but 40 is the practical limit
- **Why**: Limits exist to manage context window and help AI choose tools effectively

**User Experience**:
- User reported Cursor warning: "too many MCP servers and too many tools"
- After disabling unused MCP servers, Playwright tools became available
- This freed up capacity within the 40-tool limit

**Implication**:
- **40-tool hard limit** - Tools beyond this won't be available to AI agents
- Disabling unused servers is **essential** to stay under the limit
- Only the first 40 tools are sent to the AI agent
- If you have 41+ tools, the 41st tool won't be accessible

**Recommendation**:
- **Only enable MCP servers you actively need**
- **Disable servers that aren't being used**
- **Monitor tool count** in Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP
- **If tools aren't appearing, disable other servers** to free up capacity

### Configuration Requirements
1. **mcp.json configuration** - Required for server setup
2. **Environment variables** - Required for browser detection
3. **Full paths** - Recommended for NVM setups
4. **UI enablement** - **CRITICAL** - Required to expose tools

<!-- section_id: "ee4e1a65-c8a3-4728-9a23-1b315325969b" -->
### Tool Availability
- After enabling in UI: Tools immediately available
- Before enabling in UI: Tools configured but not accessible
- After restart: May need to re-enable in UI (enablement may not persist)

## Troubleshooting

<!-- section_id: "6746f0b7-566c-4700-874b-5768640f1555" -->
### Tools Not Available After Configuration
1. Check Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP
2. Verify server is enabled (green toggle)
3. If disabled, toggle ON
4. Wait for "X tools enabled" status

<!-- section_id: "bce51b0f-0869-4735-a61b-6841c7e38fdf" -->
### Tools Not Available After Restart
1. Check if server is still enabled in UI
2. Re-enable if needed
3. Enablement may not persist across restarts

<!-- section_id: "407b9012-3ae1-47fa-b606-7c3bf689d507" -->
### Cursor Warning About Too Many MCP Servers/Tools
1. Go to Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP
2. Review all enabled servers
3. Disable servers you're not actively using
4. Try enabling the server you need again
5. This may free up capacity for new tools

<!-- section_id: "80eb8278-7380-4aea-a27b-133a45d821d6" -->
### Browser Detection Issues
1. Verify `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set correctly
2. Check browser installation: `ls ~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-*/`
3. Use full npx path if using NVM
