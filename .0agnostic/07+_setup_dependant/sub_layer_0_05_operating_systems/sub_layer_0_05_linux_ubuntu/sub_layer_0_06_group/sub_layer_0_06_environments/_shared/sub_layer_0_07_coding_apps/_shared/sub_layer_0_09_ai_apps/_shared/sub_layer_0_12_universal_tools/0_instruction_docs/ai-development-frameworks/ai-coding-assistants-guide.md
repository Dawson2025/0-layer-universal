## Conclusion

AI coding assistants are powerful tools that can significantly enhance development productivity. The key is choosing the right tool for your workflow, team, and project requirements.

**Quick Decision Framework**:
- Need structure? → Choose framework (Spec Kit/BMAD) + assistant
- Privacy critical? → Qwen3 or Aider
- Large team? → Windsurf or Cursor
- Quick edits? → Copilot or Aider
- Deep analysis? → Claude Code

**Remember**: AI assistants are tools to augment your development, not replace critical thinking and code review processes.
