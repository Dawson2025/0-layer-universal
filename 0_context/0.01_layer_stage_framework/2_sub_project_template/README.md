# Sub-Project Layer Template (2.x, zero-padded)

Use this to scaffold any sub-project within a parent project. Sub-projects are nested projects that warrant their own scope, lifecycle, and potentially their own Git repository (submodule).

**This template implements Layer 2 (Sub-Project) of the Layer + Stage Framework.**

The Sub-Project layer inherits Project (L1) constraints and adds sub-project-specific context. For architectural details, see:
- [`architecture.md`](../../-1_research/-1.01_things_researched/ai_manager_hierarchy_system/things_learned/ideal_ai_manager_hierarchy_system/architecture.md) – Layer inheritance and sub-project responsibilities
- [`FLEXIBLE_LAYERING_SYSTEM.md`](../FLEXIBLE_LAYERING_SYSTEM.md) – Flexible nesting patterns

## When to Use a Sub-Project

Use this template when you have a nested project that:
- Has its own distinct scope and lifecycle
- Warrants its own Git repository (as a submodule of the parent)
- Contains multiple features/components of its own
- Examples: Individual classes within a school project, microservices within a monorepo

## Manager + Handoff (layer_2/)
- layer_2_00_ai_manager_system: sub-project-level manager docs/configs.
- layer_2_01_manager_handoff_documents: `2.00_to_universal/` and `2.01_to_specific/` for up/downstream handoffs.

## Slots (stored under `layer_2/layer_2_02_sub_layers/` as `sub_layer_2.xx_*`)
- sub_layer_2.01_basic_prompts: sub-project init + what-to-do-next prompts.
- sub_layer_2.02_sub_project_se_knowledge: SE/domain knowledge this sub-project relies on.
- sub_layer_2.03_sub_project_principles: sub-project-specific design/UX/security principles.
- sub_layer_2.04_sub_project_rules: hard rules (branching, testing, compliance).
- sub_layer_2.05_sub_project_os_setup: OS targets/requirements for dev/prod.
- sub_layer_2.06_sub_project_coding_app_setup: IDE/run/debug configs for this sub-project.
- sub_layer_2.07_sub_project_apps_browsers_extensions_setup: dashboards, admin panels, monitoring tools, browser extensions.
- sub_layer_2.08_sub_project_ai_apps_tools_setup: sub-project-specific AI apps/tools configuration.
- sub_layer_2.09_sub_project_mcp_servers_and_tools_setup: sub-project-specific MCP server setup (depends on 2.08).
- sub_layer_2.10_sub_project_ai_models: approved models for this sub-project and their uses.
- sub_layer_2.11_sub_project_tools: sub-project-specific scripts/CLIs/migrations.
- sub_layer_2.12_sub_project_agent_setup: sub-project-specific agent configuration with model fallbacks.

## Nested Content Directories (layer_3/)

**Same-Type Nesting Rule:** The "sub" prefix only applies to same-type nesting. Since a feature inside a sub_project is a different type (not project→project), features and components here do NOT use the "sub" prefix.

- layer_3/layer_3_sub*2_projects/: Nested sub*2-projects within this sub-project (project→project = same-type)
- layer_3/layer_3_features/: Features within this sub-project (project→feature = different type, NO "sub")
- layer_3/layer_3_components/: Components within this sub-project (project→component = different type, NO "sub")

## Stages (layer_2/layer_2_99_stages/, folders named `stage_2.xx_*`)
- stage_2.00_request_gathering
- stage_2.01_instructions
- stage_2.02_planning
- stage_2.03_design
- stage_2.04_development
- stage_2.05_testing
- stage_2.06_criticism
- stage_2.07_fixing
- stage_2.09_archives

Copy, rename to `layer_2_sub_project_<name>`, and populate each slot.
