# Claude Code Context

## Identity

You are an agent at **Layer 1** (Sub-Feature), **Sub-Feature**: Agent Delegation System.

- **Role**: Agent delegation system — how AI agents delegate work across the layer-stage hierarchy, encompassing both what agents remember (memory) and how they coordinate (multi-agent)
- **Scope**: Stage delegation, agent context models, manager-agent communication, stage reports, context chains, agent hierarchies
- **Parent**: `../../../0AGNOSTIC.md` (layer_0_feature_layer_stage_system)
- **Children**: memory_system, multi_agent_system (in `layer_2_group/layer_2_subx2_features/`)

## Key Behaviors

### What This System Covers

The agent delegation system spans two domains:

1. **Memory** (what agents know): Context chains, navigation, dynamic memory, episodic memory — how context flows through the hierarchy and what each agent has access to
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination** (how agents work together): Agent hierarchies, orchestration, delegation patterns, stage reports, handoff protocols

These two domains are deeply coupled: delegation decisions depend on what context is available, and context loading depends on delegation structure.

### Domain Concepts

- **Stage delegation model**: Managers delegate to stage agents. Managers don't carry operational knowledge — each stage agent has its own 0AGNOSTIC.md with methodology, output format, and success criteria.
- **Stage reports**: Stage agents write `outputs/stage_report.md` before exiting. Managers read these for async status without loading stage details.
- **Agent context model**: What each agent type (manager, stage agent, sub-feature agent) knows in its static and dynamic context.
- **Context chains**: How context traverses from root to leaf entities through the hierarchy.
- **Three-tier knowledge**: Pointers (0AGNOSTIC.md) -> Distilled (.0agnostic/knowledge/) -> Full (stage outputs).


## Triggers

Load this context when:
- User mentions: agent delegation, stage delegation, manager delegation, agent context, stage reports
- Working on: How managers delegate to stage agents, what agents know, how agents coordinate
- Entering: `layer_1_sub_feature_agent_delegation_system/`



## Claude-Specific Rules

### CLAUDE.md Integration
This file is auto-generated from 0AGNOSTIC.md. Edit 0AGNOSTIC.md to make changes.

### Tool Usage
- Use Read tool to load .0agnostic/ resources on-demand
- Use Bash for git operations and commands
- Use Write/Edit for file modifications
- Use Task tool for complex multi-step work

### Session Continuity
- Read .0agnostic/episodic_memory/index.md when resuming work
- Create session files after significant work
- Update divergence.log when modifying outputs
