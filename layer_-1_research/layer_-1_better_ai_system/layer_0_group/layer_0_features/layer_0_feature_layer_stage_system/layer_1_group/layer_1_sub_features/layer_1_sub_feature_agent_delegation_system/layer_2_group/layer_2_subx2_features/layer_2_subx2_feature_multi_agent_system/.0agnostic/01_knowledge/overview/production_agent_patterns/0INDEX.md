# Agent Coordination Knowledge

## Purpose

This folder documents how AI agents coordinate work across layers, stages, and sub-layers - including when to expand scope versus delegate to other agents.

    EXPAND SCOPE (manageable)

## Key Concepts

### Scope Expansion
- Load additional layer/stage context yourself
- Maintain continuity and full context
- Best for: small tasks, tightly coupled work, sequential dependencies

### Delegation
- Spawn agents at other entry points via CLI
- Communicate via handoff documents
- Best for: large tasks, parallel work, specialized domains

### Entry Points
Every layer, stage, sub-layer, or sub-stage with a CLAUDE.md can be an agent entry point.
