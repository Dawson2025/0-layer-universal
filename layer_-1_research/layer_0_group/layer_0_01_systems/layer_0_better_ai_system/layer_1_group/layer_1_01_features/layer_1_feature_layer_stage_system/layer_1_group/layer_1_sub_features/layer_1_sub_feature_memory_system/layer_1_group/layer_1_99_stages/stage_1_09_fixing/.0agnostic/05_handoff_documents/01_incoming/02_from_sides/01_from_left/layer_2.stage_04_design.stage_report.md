# Stage Report: 04_design (Memory System)

<!-- section_id: "bb8660a9-67a1-4cc3-87fd-59e9844ca066" -->
## Status
**active** — 4 architecture documents produced, avenue web restructured

<!-- section_id: "e76bed8f-e445-4ce6-bbdf-03b46be40840" -->
## Last Updated

## Summary

Architecture and design for memory system integration into the layer-stage framework. 4 design documents translate 38 research documents into concrete specifications: unified sync orchestration, data-based avenue expansion (avenues 09-13), enriched skill model with trajectory stores, and holistic source-of-truth-to-avenue flow. Avenue web physically restructured with 01_file_based/ and 02_data_based/ subdirectories.

## Key Outputs

- `outputs/by_topic/01_unified_sync_architecture.md` — sync-main.sh orchestrator spec, sync registry, dependency ordering
- `outputs/by_topic/02_data_avenue_web_expansion.md` — Avenues 09-13 design with schemas for KG, relational, vectors, temporal, SHIMI
- `outputs/by_topic/03_enriched_skill_model.md` — Skills as mini-entities with trajectory, temporal, knowledge, rules subdirs
- `outputs/by_topic/04_source_of_truth_to_avenue_flow.md` — Holistic context ordering: 0AGNOSTIC.md → source dirs → avenue web
- `outputs/by_topic/05_design_index.md` — Index of all design documents with research traceability
- Root `.0agnostic/06_context_avenue_web/` restructured: 01_file_based/ (01-08) + 02_data_based/ (09-13)
- Avenue registry: REGISTRY.md + sync-registry.json at 00_context_avenue_web_registry/
- 5 data-based avenue directories scaffolded with READMEs

## Key Findings

- The .0agnostic/ numbering (01-05 content, 06 delivery, 07+ environment) naturally encodes the source-of-truth-to-avenue flow
- File-based avenues are sufficient for zero-dependency operation; data-based avenues are optional accelerators
- A single sync-main.sh orchestrator can coordinate all existing + future sync scripts with dependency ordering
- Skills can be enriched with trajectory stores and temporal data without becoming full entities

<!-- section_id: "878ea285-ec6f-43c7-8894-9b3a6823a2d6" -->
## Open Items

- sync-main.sh implementation needed (stage 06)
- Data-based avenue build scripts needed (stage 06)
- Enriched skill model not yet applied to existing skills (stage 06)
- Testing and validation (stage 07)

## Handoff

- **Ready for next stage**: yes
- **Next stage**: 06_development
- **What next stage needs to know**: Start with sync-main.sh (foundation), then build-graph.sh (avenue 09), then build-index.sh (avenue 10). Enriched skill model can proceed in parallel. All designs maintain backward compatibility.
