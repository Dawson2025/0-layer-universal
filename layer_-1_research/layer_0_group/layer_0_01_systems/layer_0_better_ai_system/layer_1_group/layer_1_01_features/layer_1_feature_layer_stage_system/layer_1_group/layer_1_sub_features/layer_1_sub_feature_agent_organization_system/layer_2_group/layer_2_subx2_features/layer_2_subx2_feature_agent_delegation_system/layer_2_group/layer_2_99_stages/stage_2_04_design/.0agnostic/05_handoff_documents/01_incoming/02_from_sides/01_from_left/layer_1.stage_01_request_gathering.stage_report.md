# Stage Report: 01_request_gathering

## Status
active

## Last Updated
2026-02-19

## Summary
Requirements structured as a tree of needs with 9 leaf needs across 3 branches (delegation_model, memory_integration, coordination_patterns). All needs have requirements/ and user_stories/ subdirectories with enriched READMEs and user-perspective stories. Requirements inform two child entities: memory_system and multi_agent_system.

## Key Outputs
- `outputs/requests/tree_of_needs/`: 102 files — full tree with root, 3 branches, 9 leaf needs
- Each need: README.md + requirements/ (REQ-NN files + index) + user_stories/ (US-NN files + index)
- `outputs/requests/tree_of_needs/_meta/`: VERSION.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, CHANGELOG.md

## Findings
- Branch 01 (delegation_model) is foundational — defines prerequisites for branches 02 and 03
- Three failure modes without delegation model: context overflow, identity-less agents, no async status
- Many needs already partially implemented via universal artifacts (stage guides, rules, protocols)
- Scope boundary decisions and two-halves context pattern emerged as new needs → Principles 8 and 9

## Open Items
- Formal priority ordering across all 9 needs not yet done
- User validation of the complete tree not yet done
- Acceptance criteria need checking against existing universal artifacts

## Handoff
- **Ready for next stage**: yes
- **Next stage**: 02_research
- **What next stage needs to know**: Research was conducted implicitly through context_chain_system — formalize findings as research documents
