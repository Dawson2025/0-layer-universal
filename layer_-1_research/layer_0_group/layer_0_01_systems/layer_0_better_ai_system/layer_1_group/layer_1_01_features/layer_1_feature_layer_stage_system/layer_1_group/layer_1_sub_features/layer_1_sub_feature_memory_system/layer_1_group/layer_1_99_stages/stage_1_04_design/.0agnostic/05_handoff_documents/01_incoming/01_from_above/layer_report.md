## Summary

The memory_system entity researches how AI agents remember, load, and navigate context. Stage 02 (research) has produced comprehensive findings across 24 research documents (~350KB), covering biological memory foundations, AI memory architectures, data structures, commercial platforms, and performance benchmarks. The entity is ready to transition from research into instructions (stage 03) and design (stage 04).

## Key Findings

- Memory types form a 6-level biological dependency chain (sensory through autobiographical)
- AI memory systems have 9 tiers of foundational importance; minimal core = Vectors + SQL + Working Memory
- SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index) provides meaning-driven retrieval superior to flat vector search
- Unified PostgreSQL architecture (pgvector + TimescaleDB + JSONB) reduces cost 66%
- 4-stage consolidation pipeline (extract, consolidate, store, retrieve) is the standard architecture
- Procedural memory (Mem^p framework) improves agent success by +8 points

## Open Items

- Prototype implementation not yet started (see research doc 19_prototype_specification.md)
- SHIMI integration specifics for the layer-stage system need design work
- Emotional and spatial memory types not yet mapped to concrete AI implementations
- Multi-agent memory synchronization patterns need deeper investigation

## Handoff Notes

- **Ready for next stage**: Yes -- research is comprehensive
- **Next stage**: 03_instructions (codify research into implementation requirements)
- **Then**: 04_planning (planning based on instructions), 05_design (architecture design)
- **Starting point for stage 03**: Use the 9-tier core AI memory systems (doc 23) as the architectural framework. The minimal core (vectors + SQL + working memory) should be Phase 1 scope. SHIMI and procedural memory are Phase 2 enhancements. The unified PostgreSQL approach is the recommended storage strategy.
