## Summary

The agent delegation system defines how AI agents delegate work across the layer-stage hierarchy. It spans two domains: memory (what agents know) and multi-agent coordination (how agents work together). Four of eleven stages have produced content, yielding universal artifacts now in active use: 11 stage guides, 10 delegation principles, 5 rules, 1 stage report protocol, and a context propagation design. One child entity (memory_system) has completed substantial research; the other (multi_agent_system) is scaffolded.

## Stage Progress

4 active stages (01, 02, 04, 06) out of 11. See `stages_report.md` for full details.

| Stage | Key Contribution |
|-------|-----------------|
| 01 request_gathering | 9 requirements across 3 branches: delegation_model, memory_integration, coordination_patterns |
| 02 research | Investigation via context_chain_system as living laboratory |
| 04 design | 8 architecture decisions including context propagation design |
| 06 development | Universal artifacts: stage guides, principles, rules, protocol |

## Child Entity Progress

1 of 2 children reporting. See `child_layers_report.md` for full details.

| Child | Status | Summary |
|-------|--------|---------|

## Key Discoveries

- **Two-Halves Pattern** (P9): Every 0AGNOSTIC.md needs operational guidance + current state summary
- **Scope Boundary Decisions** (P8): Three options when hitting boundaries — do it yourself, delegate, or instantiate
- **Context Propagation Funnel**: outputs → output_report → .0agnostic → stage_report → 0AGNOSTIC.md
- **Entity Consolidation**: stages_report + child_layers_report → layer_report → 0AGNOSTIC.md

## Open Items

- Agent context model needs dedicated design doc
- Multi-agent spawning patterns not yet designed
- multi_agent_system child entity not yet developed
- Stage 02 has no formal research documents (findings embedded in context_chain_system)
- Testing (stage 07) not yet started, though artifacts are validated via context_chain_system (76 PASS tests)

## Handoff

- **Ready for parent**: Yes — universal artifacts in use, working example established
- **Next priorities**: Testing (stage 07), memory_system stage 03 (instructions), multi_agent_system kickoff
- **Consolidation documents**: `stages_report.md` and `child_layers_report.md` available alongside this report
