## Summary

Comprehensive research into AI agent memory systems covering biological foundations, cognitive science mappings, implementation architectures, data structures, commercial platforms, performance benchmarks, and layer-stage system comparisons. 38 research documents produced spanning ~600KB of distilled knowledge.

  - Docs 00-20: Foundation (taxonomy, cognitive science, frameworks)
  - Docs 21-23: Hierarchies (biological, data structure, AI systems)
  - Docs 24-28: Deep dives (per-type implementations, SQL schemas)
  - Docs 29-31: Real-world systems (Mem0, CrewAI, OASIS, AI tutors)
  - Docs 32-37: Comparisons (layer-stage vs commercial systems)
- `.0agnostic/01_knowledge/memory_systems/docs/core_ai_memory_architecture.md` — Distilled knowledge summary

## Key Findings

- Memory types form a 6-level biological dependency chain (sensory → autobiographical)
- AI memory systems have 9 tiers of foundational importance; the minimal core is: Vector Embeddings + SQL + Working Memory
- SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index) provides meaning-driven retrieval superior to flat vector search
- Modern production systems consolidate all memory in PostgreSQL (pgvector + hypertables + JSONB) for 66% cost reduction
- Procedural memory (Mem^p framework) improves agent success rates by +8 points and reduces steps by 18%
- The 4-stage consolidation pipeline (extract → consolidate → store → retrieve) is the standard architecture
- All data structures reduce to: arrays, trees (B-trees), graphs (HNSW, adjacency lists), and hash tables

## Open Items

- Prototype implementation not yet started (see `19_prototype_specification.md`)
- SHIMI integration specifics for the layer-stage system need design work
- Emotional and spatial memory types not yet mapped to concrete AI implementations
- Multi-agent memory synchronization patterns need deeper investigation

## Handoff

- **Ready for next stage**: yes (research is comprehensive)
- **Next stage**: 03_instructions (to codify research into implementation requirements)
- **What next stage needs to know**: Start with the 9-tier core AI memory systems (doc 23) as the architectural framework. The minimal core (vectors + SQL + working memory) should be the Phase 1 scope. SHIMI and procedural memory are Phase 2 enhancements. The unified PostgreSQL approach is the recommended storage strategy.
