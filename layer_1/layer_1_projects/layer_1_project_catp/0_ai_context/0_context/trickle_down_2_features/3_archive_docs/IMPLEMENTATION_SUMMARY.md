# Letter-Based Filtering System Implementation Summary

<!-- section_id: "414f688b-1358-4942-ab2d-cbd4062896df" -->
## Overview

The Language Tracker App has been successfully enhanced with a comprehensive letter-based filtering system for the table-based word creation method. This system allows users to dynamically filter phoneme tables by position and length type using intuitive two-letter commands.

<!-- section_id: "5264e848-6c95-419d-b302-c8b04cb2ad30" -->
## What Was Implemented

<!-- section_id: "229773ea-e164-4fa8-914d-fe80ab7f358f" -->
### 1. Core Functionality

- **Letter-based filtering commands**: Users can filter phoneme tables using two-letter codes
- **Position-based numbering**: Each position (onset, nucleus, coda) has its own numbering starting from 1
- **Frequency sorting**: Phonemes are sorted by frequency in ascending order (least frequent first)
- **Dynamic table updates**: Tables automatically refresh when filters are applied
- **Support for both CVC and CV syllable types**

<!-- section_id: "c113a9e1-f0ec-4854-92a6-6ff17ddb9e64" -->
### 2. Filter Command System

#### Position Mapping
- `a` = onset
- `b` = nucleus  
- `c` = coda

#### Length Type Mapping
- `a` = single phonemes (single consonants, monophthongs)
- `b` = cluster/diphthong types (cluster2, diphthongs)
- `c` = complex clusters (cluster3)
- `d` = all phoneme types for the position

#### Examples
- `aa` = onset single consonants
- `bb` = nucleus diphthongs
- `cc` = coda cluster3
- `ad` = onset all phoneme types
- `bc` = nucleus all phoneme types (monophthongs + diphthongs)
- `ab,bb,cb` = multiple positions at once

<!-- section_id: "c071e97d-cc98-4d16-b459-c519bcef202a" -->
### 3. Default Behavior

When the table-based method is first displayed:
- **Onset**: Shows single consonants (type 'a')
- **Nucleus**: Shows monophthongs (type 'a')
- **Coda**: Shows single consonants (type 'a')

## Technical Implementation

<!-- section_id: "75441620-3ceb-4e52-949f-f94ad49a1ec3" -->
### New Functions

1. **`display_phoneme_tables_side_by_side_with_filters()`**
   - Core display function that handles filtering
   - Sorts phonemes by frequency in ascending order
   - Applies position-based numbering
   - Updates table headers to show current filters

2. **`select_phonemes_by_numbers_or_filters()`**
   - Handles both number-based phoneme selection and letter-based filtering
   - Maintains filter state across interactions
   - Parses and applies filter commands
   - Re-displays tables when filters change

3. **`display_phoneme_tables_side_by_side_with_numbers()`**
   - Wrapper function that calls the filter function with default settings
   - Maintains backward compatibility

<!-- section_id: "c89198e6-8fcb-4c36-b2e3-9ba8a886a4c5" -->
### Modified Functions

1. **`create_word_table_based()`**
   - Updated to use the new selection function
   - Maintains the same user interface

<!-- section_id: "537631c2-7272-4409-8801-ea81c8ab3dde" -->
## User Experience

<!-- section_id: "bc3b2bc6-1562-4709-ae66-e2a0e55fc06a" -->
### Complete User Story

1. **User selects "Add new word" → "Table-based method"**
2. **Default tables are displayed** showing:
   - Onset: single consonants (numbered 1-N)
   - Nucleus: monophthongs (numbered 1-N)
   - Coda: single consonants (numbered 1-N)
3. **User can apply filters** using letter commands:
   - `bb` to show nucleus diphthongs
   - `ab,bb,cb` to show cluster/diphthong types for all positions
   - `ad` to show all onset phoneme types
4. **Tables automatically refresh** with new filters applied
5. **User selects phonemes** using numbers (e.g., "1, 1, 1")
6. **Word is created** with the selected phonemes

### For Developers

The system is designed to be extensible:
- New filter commands can be added by modifying the mapping dictionaries
- Additional syllable types can be supported by extending the position logic
- The filtering system is modular and can be reused in other parts of the application

2. **Dynamic Filtering**: Tables update in real-time as filters are applied
3. **Flexible Selection**: Users can mix filtering and number-based selection
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same filtering system works for both CVC and CV syllable types
5. **Performance**: Efficient sorting and filtering algorithms
6. **Maintainable Code**: Clean separation of concerns and well-tested functions

## Conclusion

The letter-based filtering system has been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. It provides an intuitive and powerful way for users to interact with phoneme tables, making the word creation process more efficient and user-friendly. The system maintains backward compatibility while adding significant new functionality.

All tests pass, the code is syntactically correct, and the system is ready for production use.
